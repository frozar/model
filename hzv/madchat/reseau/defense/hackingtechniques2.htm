<BR><BR><BR><BR><B><A name=intro>Intro</A></B> <BR>Welcome to the 2nd issue of 
Hacking Techniques.&nbsp; If you read the first one I am glad to see you liked 
it enough to want to read this one.&nbsp; This issue will focus on how hackers 
bounce their attacks so that they do not get caught and so they use the power of 
a *nix shell.&nbsp; As with the first one this tutorial can both be used by 
hackers and admins.&nbsp; Hackers will learn how to mount an attack and use 
proxies to help stay anonymous.&nbsp; Admins will learn how to prevent 
themselves from being used in an attack as a proxy and prevent stress.&nbsp; If 
you don't know what a proxy is or how to use a wingate you need to read this 
tutorial.&nbsp; People who run wingates, proxies, or give shells out also should 
go over this tutorial as to scare them into securing it.&nbsp; I'll go over a 
few other random things such as using routers as wingates, and using wingates to 
bounce your irc sessions. <BR><BR><BR><B><A name=bouncingattacks>Bouncing 
Attacks</A></B> <BR>There are a few ways to bounce your attack.&nbsp; Sometimes 
it depends on how you are gonna to do the attack, sometimes it depends on what 
you got on hand.&nbsp; I will introduce you to 3 ways to bounce you 
attack.&nbsp; I will not go into using routers as proxies since wingates are 
fairly easy to get.&nbsp; And I will not go over bouncing your attack off an ftp 
because all (or very close to all) ftp programs are patched to this by now. Not 
only should hackers read this next part, but so should admins who want to keep 
themselves from being used in an attack.&nbsp; Securing their proxies and 
wingates can help prevent trouble with hackers abusing it. This can save some 
time and hassle because you will not need to bother with an admin who trying to 
track down a hacker who used your network to bounce off of. <BR><BR>

name=proxies>Bouncing through proxies</A></U><BR>Proxies are the most basic way 
to stay anonomous while on the web.&nbsp; They are used with your web browser to 
rely data that you are downloading.&nbsp; So when you send data to get a webpage 
it is first sent to the proxy and then to the webpage.&nbsp; like this: 
<BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; <B>[your computer] -&gt; [proxy] -&gt; [website]</B> 
<BR><BR>Some kinds of proxies, known as cache'ing proxies, will hold local 
copies of websites people visit.&nbsp; This makes browsing much faster since 
ideally the connection between you and the proxy is very fast.&nbsp; So instead 
of having to query the website the proxy will just send out the saved (cache'd) 
copy and save time and resources.&nbsp; Although this can be a problem as I have 
had first hand experience with this.&nbsp; When running lame industries we put a 
script up that allowed people to check out other users email addresses, image, 
website, names, country, etc.. all info was optional.&nbsp; But the script would 
check if you were an admin of lame industries and if you were it would display 
users passwords, cookies, allow you to change the status of users.&nbsp; Now 
somehow a nice fellow named MaAaX found a cache'ing proxy that had this page 
cached.&nbsp; Not only was it cache'd.. but it was the admin version 
cache'd.&nbsp; Some admin of the site must have used that proxy to visit that 
script, so the proxy saved what he saw.&nbsp; And MaAaX reported this, but he 
was tricked into reporting it to someone who was not an admin of the site.&nbsp; 
That person then used the proxy to get an admin's password from the cache'd 
page.&nbsp; Moral of the story? Don't leave sensitive info out for everyone to 
see, I would suggest not using a proxy when admining a site through http and 
also to put all scripts which can be used by an admin in a <A 
href="http://b0iler.eyeonsecurity.org/tutorials/htaccess.html">.htaccess</A> 
protected directory. <BR><BR>Proxies are very easy to find and very easy to 
use.&nbsp; To find them try using a program called <A 
href="http://go8.163.com/windzh/indexe.htm">Proxy Hunter</A> what this program 
will do is it will scan large ranges of ips for open proxies.&nbsp; Then it will 
report them to you so you can try them and see if they require a username and 
password or if you can use them without.&nbsp; Another way is to look on the web 
for lists of proxies, a few good sites for this are: <BR><BR>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="ttp://www.cyberarmy.com/lists/proxy/index.shtml">cyberarmy's 
  proxy list</A><BR><BR>
  <LI><A href="http://tools.rosinstrument.com/proxy/">roswell's proxy 
  list</A><BR><BR></LI></UL><BR>Don't expect proxies to stay up forever, if one 
goes down try another.&nbsp; It is fairly simple to set up basic security for 
your proxy server, get a good access list restricting who can use it.&nbsp; 
Also, as with all programs, check for known security vulnerabilities in the 
proxy server itself, and vulnerabilities in your firewall, which you set the 
access list for the proxy server. <BR><BR>To use proxies you need to set up your 
browser to bounce off of them.&nbsp; In internet explorer this is done by going 
to Tools-&gt;Internet Options...-&gt;Connections-&gt;(highlighting your 
connection)-&gt;Settings...-&gt;check "Use a proxy server for this 
connection"-&gt;file in the ip or hostname and the port number then press ok, 
and ok. <BR><BR>To set up Netscape to use a proxy select 
edit-&gt;preferences-&gt;advanced-&gt;proxies-&gt;"Manual proxy configuration" 
then fill in the hostname or ip and the port number. <BR><BR>In lynx (or Mosaic) 
you would do this at the command line: 
<BR><BR>http_proxy="http://proxy.com:80/"; export http_proxy; exec lynx 
<BR><BR>or exec Mosaic. <BR><BR>Now to validate that the proxy is working go to 
a site which displays server environment variables from a perl/php script. One 
such site is <A 
href="http://www.cyberarmy.com/cgi/whoami.pl">http://www.cyberarmy.com/cgi/whoami.pl</A> 
<BR><BR>One proxy is good for everyday surfing, but what if you are up to 
alittle more than just that?&nbsp; (I see that smile on your face)&nbsp; You 
need to use a technique called chaining proxies.&nbsp; What happends is you rely 
the data transfer from one proxy, to another, to another, to another ... until 
it reaches the destination.&nbsp; It is fairly simple to do this, but some 
proxies don't support it.&nbsp; Other problems include one proxy is slow it 
makes the connection timeout, too many proxies that the connection times out, 
and it takes awhile to find 4 or 5 good proxies.&nbsp; This should work in 
almost every browser, put the proxies in the address bar in this format: 
http://proxy.com:80/http://proxy2.com:80/http://proxy3.com:8000/http://site.com 
this should connect you to site.com using those 3 proxies and the one you put in 
your configuration (options, preferences.. what we just did above).&nbsp; I've 
also heard that using http://proxy.com;80-_-http://site.com works, but from my 
experience it tends to be less supported by proxy servers. <BR><BR>Now when I 
say proxies can be used to bounce a connection to a webpage - I mean 
webpage.&nbsp; You cannot use a normal http proxy on anything besides port 80 
(the http port.. for webpages).&nbsp; If you want to bounce connections on other 
ports try a <A 
href="http://b0iler.eyeonsecurity.org/tutorials/hackingtechniques2.htm#wingates">wingate</A>. 
<BR><BR>So what if you are using an exploit to mount an attack and you are too 
lazy to use wingates to connect to your shell?&nbsp; You can use something like 
rain.forrest.puppy's libwhisker, which makes it extremely easy to add proxy 
support to perl scripts.&nbsp; You can get libwhisker at: <A 
href="http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/bins/libwhisker/pr4/libwhisker.pm">http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/bins/libwhisker/pr4/libwhisker.pm</A>&nbsp; 
I haven't really looked for a C/C++ version of something like this, since it's 
just as simple to connect to a shell, but if anyone knows one please send info 
to b0iler@hotmail.com <BR><BR>One last thing I will go over for proxies is 
chaining them together, hackers use this so they have more cover when hacking 
into a script avalible over port 80. To do this you can put 
proxy1-_-proxy2-_-proxy3-_- before the url, or you can use a program called <A 
href="http://multiproxy.org/">MultiProxy</A> to chain anonymous proxies 
together. What is an anonymous proxy? It is a proxy that will not forward 
information about you. The main peice of information hackers want to keep secret 
is their IP address, when a proxy forwards this to a computer it is known as the 
X-Forward-For. It is a header in the packet which tells the target what computer 
the proxy is going to send the info to (the hackers IP). Anonymous proxies will 
leave the X-Forward-For header blank so that the target has no idea where the 
attack is comming from. You can check if a proxy is anonymous at <A 
href="http://www.cyberarmy.com/cgi/whoami.pl">http://www.cyberarmy.com/cgi/whoami.pl</A> 
<BR><BR><BR><U><A name=wingates>Bouncing through wingates</A></U><BR>Wingates 
are a type of proxy that allow you to make a telnet connection.&nbsp; They are 
intended to be used to allow computers to access the internet through another 
one, but since many types of wingates allow anyone to connect without a password 
this can be exploited by hackers and other people to be used to bounce their 
connection off of.&nbsp; Here is how this works: <BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<B>[hacker's computer] -&gt; [wingate] -&gt; [destination]</B> <BR><BR>This 
snazzy ascii shows how your data will go through a wingate and then to it's 
destination.&nbsp; So the destination sees it as if the data is coming from the 
wingate.&nbsp; If you can't see how hackers can use this to their advantage let 
me explain... <BR><BR>Hackers want to keep their ip hidden, they don't want 
their target to know where they are coming from.&nbsp; This is both so they 
cannot block the attack as easy and so they do not get in trouble if they do get 
caught.&nbsp; Using a wingate means that the target doesn't see the hackers ip, 
it sees the wingate's ip instead.&nbsp; Most hackers use over 3 wingates when 
hacking, just to be safe.&nbsp; Because if an admin caught the hack attempt and 
contacted the admin of the wingate logs can be used to find the hackers 
ip.&nbsp; So if they bounce off of like 5 wingates that means alot more hassle 
for the attacked admin to go through to find the hacker and the more chance that 
logs will not be kept or will be deleted by one of the wingate admins. 
<BR><BR>Bouncing hacking attacks off of a wingate is not the only reason a 
hacker would use one.&nbsp; They are also quite handy when going on some irc 
servers.&nbsp; The same basic concept applies, the data is bounced off the 
wingate and then sent to the destination (irc server).&nbsp; So the irc server 
sees the connection as comming from the wingate.&nbsp; This can allow hackers to 
get around channel bans, get around glines, hide themselves from others, create 
clones, etc..&nbsp; Check your options in irc client to figure out how to use 
them. (with mirc it's known as a SOCKS 4 firewall in the options.) <BR><BR>Since 
they are useful on an irc, many people on irc tend to be using wingates.&nbsp; 
This is why I ported a simple port scanner to irssi (also works with BitchX and 
maybe Xchat).&nbsp; This port scanner is editted to only look for port 23 and 
1080 the most commonly used ports for wingates, 23 is telnet, 1080 is 
SOCKS.&nbsp; What it does is collects people's ips when they enter a channel and 
then when you issue the command /scan it will check the list of ips for avalible 
wingates.&nbsp; There is also easy to use scripts for mirc that do this, a 
search on google for mirc wingate scanner produced many links.&nbsp; You can 
also use tools that scan wide blocks of ips for wingates using tools like <A 
href="http://packetstormsecurity.org/wingate-scanner/">wingate 
scanners</A>.&nbsp; Here is a tip: find a cable or dsl isp and scan their subnet 
for wingates.&nbsp; Many people on fast connections use wingates for their 
network to split their bandwidth up and since cable they have a static ip they 
will not change as often.&nbsp; So do a '/whois user' on someone who is on cable 
to get their ip, then check <A 
href="http://all-nettools.com/tools1.htm">all-nettols.com</A> (use "smartwhois") 
to get their isp's ip range and I scan that for wingates. <BR><BR>Wingates tend 
to go up and down hourly, this is because sometimes people only need them for 
awhile and when someone does put one up they get alot of traffic from hackers 
using them to bounce off of, so instead of wasting their bandwidth they secure 
the wingate or take it down.&nbsp; Because of this you need to scan for wingates 
all the time.&nbsp; Another reason why irc works good for looking for wingates, 
you let other people find them for you. =) <BR><BR>Not many hackers just use 1 
wingate when hacking. This is how using 4 wingates would work: <BR><BR>&nbsp; 
&nbsp; <B>[hacker's computer] -&gt; [wingate] -&gt; [wingate] -&gt; [wingate] 
-&gt; [wingate] -&gt; [destination]</B> <BR><BR>Using multiple wingates is 
required for a hacker, they will not just use one, since it would be easy to 
track them.&nbsp; But using too many can make things very slow.&nbsp; Anything 
over 4 and under 10 would be normal. <BR><BR>So after you scan (this may take 
awhile, be patient) and get a few wingates how do you connect to them and use 
them? This is very simple, but tends to be asked all the time on message boards 
and chatrooms all over the place.&nbsp; When you telnet to a wingate you need to 
have it's ip or hostname and the port the wingate is running on.&nbsp; Normally 
the port is 23 or 1080.&nbsp; Now we can only use wingates which don't require a 
username and password to use.&nbsp; So after we get a list of them we will need 
to test and see which work without a login.&nbsp; Simply get out telnet and 
connect to that ip and port, wait for the connection and see if it says 
something like this: <BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Wingate&gt;</B> <BR><BR>If it had 
a login of some sort then you cannot use it.&nbsp; This is one way admins of 
wingates can protect themselves, make sure to password protect the wingate so 
random hackers cannot use it.&nbsp; Not only can hackers use your wingate, but 
spammers often use them aswell.&nbsp; Having spammers send thousands of emails 
through your wingate is a surefire way to get your isp to cancel your 
account.&nbsp; Besides adding passwords you can also secure your wingate by only 
allowing computers on your LAN to access it, this is how for <A 
href="http://www.infopulse.net/store/index.html">GateKeeper</A>: <BR><BR>login 
as Administrator on GateKeeper<BR>Policies -&gt; Default Policies -&gt; Users 
can access services -&gt; select everyone<BR>Location -&gt; Specify locations 
from where this recipient has rights -&gt; <BR>add 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.0.* (or 
whatever ip range your network uses). <BR><BR>To secure <A 
href="http://wingate.deerfield.com/">Deerfield's wingate</A> simply upgrade to 
3.x home version. The home version of 3.x doesn't let anyone connect at default. 
It's now configured securely by default :D <BR><BR>There are also other 
terminal's that will appear, it is not allways "Wingate&gt;".&nbsp; It could be 
anything, Wingate&gt; is just default on some. <BR><BR>We got connected, now to 
use the wingate.&nbsp; Wingates by default will telnet to any ip port you enter, 
so try to telnet to a server you know is up: <BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<B>Wingate&gt; 204.42.253.18:23</B> <BR><BR>Now if you encounter an error this 
means somethings ether wrong with the ip:port you entered, the ip:port is down, 
or the wingate is not working.&nbsp; Also try to do 'telnet ip:port' since that 
wingate might not telnet at default.&nbsp; So we got our list of wingates down 
to a list of working, none passworded wingate.&nbsp; Now to link them.&nbsp; 
Lets say we have the wingates (note, these are fake): <BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<B>203.43.25.104 port 23<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 214.133.200.20 port 1080<BR>&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 180.23.56.93 port 23<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 194.51.107.68 port 23</B> 
<BR><BR>To link these we would telnet into the first one: <BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<I>telnet 203.43.25.104 23</I><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Sparky's server 1.03&gt;</B> 
<BR><BR>Then enter in the ip:port of the next one on the list. <BR><BR>&nbsp; 
&nbsp; <B>Sparky's server 1.03&gt; </B><I>214.133.200.20 1080</I><BR>&nbsp; 
&nbsp; <B>CDD Proxy Server&gt;</B> <BR><BR>and link the rest.. <BR><BR>&nbsp; 
&nbsp; <B>CDD Proxy Server&gt; </B><I>180.23.56.93 23</I><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<B>welcome to 180.23.56.93: </B><I>194.51.107.68 23</I> <BR><BR>Now A hacker can 
telnet into a shell account from the last wingate and launch the attack, or if 
they know how to do some socket programming they can set up exploits to go 
through wingates themselves.&nbsp; For the next section , <A 
href="http://b0iler.eyeonsecurity.org/tutorials/hackingtechniques2.htm#shells">shells</A>, 
I'll go over how a hacker can use a shell to make his attack. <BR><BR>I have 
heard from a few people that routers can be used as a wingate, I myself have 
never done this since there is always plenty of wingates to use if you just scan 
for them.&nbsp; But.. using a router as a wingate is very interesting for a 
number of reasons.&nbsp; First, a router gets so much traffic that the admin 
would probably not know if it was being used to bounce an attack.&nbsp; Routers 
don't log by default, and since they get alot of traffic not many admins log 
everything (or they're logs do not last too long) this means there is less of a 
chance of the hacker getting tracked down.&nbsp; Routers are pretty much always 
up and have a fast connection, so if you got a few routers going as wingates you 
wouldn't have to scan for new ones as much =) <BR><BR>Now don't go out looking 
for routers just yet, before you can use a router as a wingate you need to have 
access to use telnet on it.&nbsp; Unlike wingates which can sometimes allow 
anyone to run telnet, routers don't.&nbsp; You will need to hack into the router 
to beable to use telnet on it to wingate from it.&nbsp; Of course the number of 
routers with default passwords (admin:admin) or simple exploits not patched is 
pretty high from my experience.&nbsp; Also to note: it might not be a good idea 
to telnet directly into a router as your first wingate.. if the admin does find 
out of your break in (and they log) you will have left your real ip.&nbsp; 
Hackers will probably use a regular wingate or two before connecting to a 
comprimized router.&nbsp; Needless to say, if you admin a router make sure to 
keep it locked up tight, not only can hackers screw up your network, sniff 
passwords, redirect data, and generally cause a muck, but they can also use your 
router as a launching pad for their next attack. <BR><BR>Another use for 
wingates is to use them to bounce a connection off of irc.&nbsp; Most commonly 
SOCKS (stands for SOCK-et-S), are used for irc, they are very simular to 
wingates but used mainly at a firewall to allow transparent connections through 
it.&nbsp; SOCKS usually run on port 1080.&nbsp; To bounce your connection to an 
IRC server with a wingate or SOCKS type the following in your irc client: 
<BR><BR>/server win.gate.com 23<BR>/quote irc.box.sk 6667<BR>/quote user 
grendelsucks 123.123.123.123 b0iler :ban evader<BR>/quote nick b0iler2 
<BR><BR>then use irc like normal, you will have the ip or hostname of the 
wingate.&nbsp; I believe if you use mirc you can go to File -&gt; Options -&gt; 
Connect -&gt; Firewall and then enter in the wingate's IP and port and checking 
"Use SOCKS Firewall" (correct me if I am wrong). &nbsp; If you use Xchat try 
Settings -&gt; Setup -&gt; IRC -&gt; Proxy Server -&gt; Fill in IP and port and 
select the type as wingate.&nbsp; You can also use a bnc (stands for BouNCe) to 
rely your connection to an IRC server. <BR><BR>Same as with proxies, if you 
don't want people connecting to your wingate set up a strict access list on a 
firewall.&nbsp; Also username and passwords are a good idea when it comes to 
wingates. <BR><BR><BR><U>Shell Accounts</U> <BR>A shell account is having access 
to a remote computer.&nbsp; Users can connect to them and issue commands just 
like if they were at that computer's keyboard.&nbsp; This also means that 
hackers can issue commands, and they often use shell accounts as another way to 
bounce their attack. <BR><BR>Usually a shell account is used along with wingates 
and is used by the hacker to launch the attack.&nbsp; Hackers will not use free 
shells such as nether.net or hobbiton.org because they do not have the ablity to 
run programs they need and they cannot delete the log files with a regular user 
account.&nbsp; If they were to use one of these shells the admin could easily 
check the logs and see what they were upto.&nbsp; So hackers will use what are 
known as root shells, these are systems the hacker has already comprized and has 
root on them.&nbsp; This allows them to delete all nessasary logs of their 
attack and lets them have full access to *nix tools.&nbsp; The key tools hackers 
need are raw packet support, nmap and other auditting programs, a c compiler, a 
perl interpreter, and exploits.&nbsp; These come standard on most *nix boxes, so 
it makes *nix very valuable to hackers.&nbsp; Although most will have *nix 
installed on their computer they might still use shells because they have faster 
connections, and will allow another layer of protection along with the wingates. 
<BR><BR>This is an example of how a hacker would use 3 wingates with 2 shells: 
<BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; <B>[hacker's computer] -&gt; [wingate] -&gt; [wingate] 
-&gt; [wingate] -&gt; [shell] -&gt; [shell] -&gt; [target]</B> <BR><BR>To login 
to the shells a hacker can use telnet or they can use <A 
href="http://www.openssh.org/">ssh</A>, whichever they want.&nbsp; ssh will 
allow a more secure connection.&nbsp; A simple: telnet owned.com:5742 would 
allow them to get in (if they set up telnetd on port 5742).&nbsp; To connect 
with ssh is: ssh owned.com -p 5742. If your system would get comprized it too 
could be used as a shell for the hackers next attack. <BR><BR>There are free 
shell accounts for beginner hackers to use, again, I stress that these are 
closely monitored and you only get a user account, so things are logged and 
power is limitted. Don't use them to hack! What a hacker wants is a 'rootshell' 
which is root access. This allows the hacker total control over everything on 
that computer. Raw sockets is a big thing, access to edit logs is another. If 
you can edit the logs on a rootshell this means that it is all the more harder 
for anyone to track you. If you use a free shell or a user account on a box you 
cannot edit the logs and will be vulnerable to be traced. Always using alot of 
wingates will help in keeping you out of trouble. <BR><BR>Most shells you will 
want are on *nix boxes, so you need to learn unix commands. Also knowing what 
files do what will help you understand how to hide yourself and how to modify 
the system the way you want. Setting up linux and securing your box will help 
you better understand how to break in, as well as breaking into linux will help 
you better understand how to secure it =) To help you learn *nix here is a few 
really good tutorials: <BR><BR>

<UL></UL><BR>How can you stop hackers from using your system? Well this is a 
very indepth question, because you will need to completely secure your box to 
stop them from gaining access to it.&nbsp; Read up on Unix security, firewalls, 
and IDS.&nbsp; Ofcourse take action before the hacker gets in, secure your 
box...&nbsp; use tripwire and snort 'just incase'.&nbsp; One way to catch them 
is to install a remote logging box. This will allow you to have logs of 
everything they do, to do this set up any old box with inetd and syslogd and 
then change syslog's configuration file to have logs sent to that box. <BR><BR># 
/etc/syslog.conf file<BR>*.* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @213.165.52.61 <BR><BR>For more 
info on setting up a secure remote logger try loki's guide on <A 
href="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/feature_stories/remote_logserver-1.html">How 
to set up a secure remote logger</A> <BR><BR>One thing I would like to stress 
about using shells from a friends box is that they may be logging everything you 
do and gathering your username:passwords to your email, hacked accounts, sites, 
ftp, nickserv, and anything else you transfer.&nbsp; Same holds true for BNCs 
and wingates.&nbsp; It's a trick passed around by many hackers to put a wingate 
on their box and put it on a hacker website's list and wait for people to log 
into their hacked accounts with it.&nbsp; I also read somewhere that governments 
set up wingates to catch hackers, I don't know how true this is.. but it sure is 
a good way to discurage hackers. <BR><BR><BR><B><A 
name=conclusion>Conclusion</A></B> <BR>In this issue of Hacking Techniques I 
went over how and why hackers use proxies, wingates, and shells when attacking 
and how admins can stop them from using their networks to bounce attacks 
from.&nbsp; I think the next issue will be much longer, it will cover many 
things hackers do once they comprize a system.&nbsp; I hope everyone learned 
atleast something from this paper, and I hope I didn't forget anything =)&nbsp; 
I am sorry if you felt it was hard to read this tutorial, I had a hard time 
writting it, it just felt like my words didn't go together right. It may be 
awhile till I get around to finishing issue #3, thanks for your patients.
