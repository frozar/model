<h2><a name="sec.1">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The battle against attackers is getting tougher. To avoid IDSs and other
defenses, attackers are using more varied and devious techniques. The latest
the latest technique is distributed attacks. Attackers may target simultaneous
attacks to a single victim from various points of the Internet. A denial of
service (DoS) attack on network bandwidth and/or some network service will be
very effective when done by a group of collaborating agents. Toward this end,
attackers may use some hosts that have been penetrated or compromised and are
located in various points of the network and the globe. Distributed probes are
very effective for mapping the topology of a network or sub-network.
Topological information is the primary input in devising a strategy to attack a
network or some host contained within the network.&nbsp; The next step is
probing for vulnerable services, once again in a distributed manner.</p>

<p>The present widely deployed defense systems like firewalls are moving
towards isolating networks and sites. The focus seems to be on protecting the
"internal" network.&nbsp; But there will always be open networking, otherwise
the basic philosophy and driving force of the Internet will collapse. There is
no escaping from the issue of defending this open Internet from hackers and
intruders. Attackers and intruders can be anywhere on the earth and deploy
collaborating agents to attack any site on the Internet. To counter the threat
posed, we need to develop technology and framework that allow collaborative
defenses and maybe even offensive measures against the mischief makers,</p>

<p>In other words, to maintain the rule of law in the Internet, it is necessary
to look beyond local defenses, to wide area attack detection and elimination
systems including attacker-tracking techniques. In this work, we propose a
cooperative system for Internet-wide illegal access detection, targeted toward
network exchange points.&nbsp; It envisages a group of sensitive sensors, the
facility of rapid information sharing, and organized reaction.</p>

<p>For the information exchange framework, we are in sync with IDWG (Intrusion
Detection Message Exchange Format [IDMEF]) working group [<a href=
"#ref.1">1</a>] of IETF, which is working on format of information to exchange
illegal access related information. The IDMEF will enable communication between
IDSs in a heterogeneous environment.</p>

<p>In this paper, we discuss the necessity and potential of a distributed
system for Internet-wide illegal access detection, which employs distributed
information collection, information sharing, and information correlation
techniques. We have developed a prototype of the distributed application. It
does SCAN detection, attacker tracking, and cooperative defense against
attacks. We have evaluated the prototype in an operational network environment
and have discussed the results.</p>

<h2><a name="sec.2">2. Recent Internet-wide illegal activities and IDS</a></h2>

<p>IDSs have focused on serious security intrusions like exploit of root
accounts. However, that is the line of defense in the war against attackers.
For proactive defense and early response, it is important to move the front
line farther into from home and closer to the attacker. In other words, the
coverage of the IDS should be expanded.</p>

<p>The well-known network mapping tool "nmap"[<a href="#ref.2">2</a>]
implements various techniques to find services and vulnerabilities in a
network, e.g., stealth scanning, or to bypasses packet filters and monitors.
Those scanning tools are likely to be distributed both in time and space to
avoid detection systems and carrying out very slow scans of randomly selected
targets. As an example of a co-operated SCAN activity, distributed traceroutes
may be carried out to find out the entry point (router) of an Intranet [<a
href="#ref.3">3</a>].</p>

<p>DoS attacks are a major issue these days. The signature of a DoS may not
seem to be serious locally, but it may affect one or more neighboring
organizations and/or ISPs. The well-known <i>smurf</i>[<a href="#ref.4">4</a>]
attack often traverses several wide-area networks and its potential impact may
be felt anywhere in the worldwide Internet. And "Tribe Flood Network" and
"Trenoo"[<a href="#ref.5">5</a>] are well-organized distributed DoS attacks.
They organize and control compromised hosts to make the effect of DoS
devastating. CERT Coordination Center published a report on recent cooperated
attacks.</p>

<p>There is a report of how smart attackers are collaborating Internet-wide in
their attacks [<a href="#ref.6">6</a>] [<a href="#ref.7">7</a>].</p>

<p>Most of the current security systems are independent, local and
concentrating on application/OS log or specialized packet tracing, to
investigate attacks on local targets however small the footprints of attackers
may be. It is difficult for such systems to have a global view of the
relationship of an insignificant abnormality that is observed locally with that
that is being seen elsewhere.</p>

<p>To raise the security level of the Internet, it is necessary to develop new
security applications based on a standard framework to ensure interoperability
and collaboration of IDS, firewall and other security systems.</p>

<h2><a name="sec.3">3. Distributed security system for Internet-wide illegal
access</a></h2>

<p>A distributed security system would comprise some security agents and a
communication system. Security agents would be IDSs, firewalls, and other
management systems, which work on information collection, sharing, and
correlation.</p>

<h3><a name="s1">3.1. Basic distributed system architecture</a></h3>

<p>Figure 1 shows the concept of our distributed system architecture. Sensors
or security agents are deployed on the links of an inter-network, at an
appropriate point for traffic monitoring and information exchange.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="1f_2a.gif" alt=
"Security application on distributed framework"><br>
<b>Fig. 1 Security application on distributed framework</b></p>

<h3><a name="s2">3.2. Inter-system communication</a></h3>

<p>The requirements [<a href="#ref.8">8</a>] and data model [<a href=
"#ref.9">9</a>] are discussed at IDWG to include details for the multi-vendor
environment. In this paper, we adopted SNMP and MIB for information exchange.
The further details are discussed in [<a href="#ref.10">10</a>], [<a href=
"#ref.11">11</a>].</p>

<p>It is important to have an idea of the communications mode(s) that will be
used by intrusion detection systems when choosing an intrusion detection alert
format, because some formats may support certain modes better than others.</p>

<p>Network management involves monitoring and manipulating information about
the elements to be managed.&nbsp; These bits and pieces of information are
abstracted as Managed Objects (MO). A detailed introduction to the current SNMP
Management Framework can be found in [<a href="#SNMPv3">12</a>].</p>

<h3><a name="s3">3.3. Distributed security applications</a></h3>

<p>In this paper, we propose three types of distributed applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distributed attacker detection system. As an example we use the case of a
SCAN</li>

<li>Attacker tracking system</li>

<li>Cooperative defense to raise the security level of the Internet</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="sec.4">4. Distributed SCAN detection</a></h2>

<p>To avoid IDSs, a scanner may send a probe packet sneakily, slowly, randomly,
or distributed. In other words, all the effort to do that is how to distribute
probes in time and spaces widely. For early detection of these attackers, a
wide area must be covered.</p>

<h3><a name="s4">4.1. SCAN detection</a></h3>

<p>The basic model of SCAN is based on a one-to-many access model (Figure 2).
SCAN detection involves detecting such a pattern.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="1f_2b.gif" alt="Typical SCAN behavior"><br>
<b>Fig. 2 Typical SCAN behavior</b></p>

<p>The pattern detection is based on the following categories of
information:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Statistical information:</b> Inter access interval and address/port
number distributions are basic statistical information. In the simplest case,
the probing actions are periodic and address/port numbers are sequential.</li>

<li><b>Packet type:</b> There are various types of packets for SCAN, e.g., ICMP
echo request, TCP SYN, TCP FIN, UDP Echo, etc. Among them, there are obvious
protocol violations, and/or suspicious packets like those with all TCP flag set
and/or source port set to 65535. SCANs which use such packets can be detected
with relatively ease. But SCANs by normal packet are masked by normal
activities</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus, carefully distributed probes with normal packets don't leave enough
samples in local scope. In this paper, we propose a distributed information
collection and correlation system using reaction packets to detect wide-area
SCAN detection.</p>

<h3><a name="s5">4.2. Minimal SCAN action</a></h3>

<p>Figure 3 shows a minimal communication model of SCAN. The scanners generate
<i>probe packets</i>. They can generate arbitrary packets. For example, TCP-SYN
packet, which is a part of TCP 3-way handshake, is normal but it can be used
for stealth scan. Reaction packets are automatically generated by network
element like routers, firewalls, or end hosts. There is information in the
errors (or absence thereof) reported in the <i>reaction packets</i>. SCAN
generally attempts exhaustive address-space probing. In such cases, most of the
attempts will result in reaction packets indicating "error" fail.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="1f_2c.gif" alt="Minimal action of SCAN"><br>
<b>Fig. 3 Minimal action of SCAN</b></p>

<h3><a name="s6">4.3. Reaction packets</a></h3>

<p>In this paper, to detect behavior of SCAN, reaction packets are focused.
Almost all TCP/IP equipment could generate reaction packets like ICMP
destination unreachable [<a href="#ref.12">13</a>]. That means those are
built-in sensors already deployed. Those good signs should not be lost.
However, to make use of them, a distributed security agent must intercept them
and report their existence. Figure 4 shows a concept of reaction packet
collection.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="1f_2d.gif" alt="Reaction packet collection"><br>
<b>Fig. 4 Reaction packet collection</b></p>

<h3><a name="s7">4.4. Correlation of information from multiple points</a></h3>

<p>To make a sensor sensitive and make its coverage wide, it is useful to
correlate information from multiple security agents. Figure 5 shows a model of
distributed SCAN detection, collected information of reaction packets are
informed to NMS by SNMP inform message, then aggregated and correlated.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="1f_2e.gif" alt="Distributed SCAN detection"><br>
<b>Fig. 5 Distributed SCAN detection</b></p>

<h2><a name="sec.5">5. Tracking the attacker</a></h2>

<p>We proposed a traffic pattern-based attacker tracking mechanism at RAID'99
Conference [<a href="#ref.13">14</a>]. That is, using the traffic pattern as
the footprint of the attacker; the correlation coefficient is used to correlate
and track the footprint.</p>

<p>Packet contents are examined to determine the source, destination, and
protocol-related details to determine the traffic profile. However, this
mechanism in traffic profiling has limited applicability, as</p>

<ul>
<li>A clever hacker will manipulate the packet contents, e.g, spoof the source
addresses whenever possible, particularly in the case of a denial of dervice
(DoS) attack.</li>

<li>The packet contents may be encrypted, making it difficult if not impossible
to decode and analyze the contents.</li>

<li>The traffic volume itself may be very large, making it a difficult task to
analyze the contents of each and every packet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, if the source address is spoofed the attack may be detected by
whatever means, but still the issue of tracing the attacker remains wide
open.</p>

<p>In such cases, profiling traffic-flow characteristics is a more appropriate
choice. Essentially, one looks for distinguishing features of the traffic
profile. For example, if there is a DoS attack in the form of a flood of
TCP-SYN packets, this can be easily detected by the entity receiving the
TCP-SYNS or by an RMON type device placed at an appropriate point in the
network. Then the source of the malicious packets may be traced by looking for
the presence of a similar flow at all the inputs of the concerned network.</p>

<h3><a name="s8">5.1. Definition of traffic pattern</a></h3>

<p>Traffic pattern is defined by the sequence of number of packets at time
slots at each monitoring point [<a href="#ref.14">15</a>], which is modeled by
size of time slot d, size of window D and metric of each slot (Figure 6).</p>

<p><img border="0" src="1f_2f.gif" alt="Model of traffic pattern"><br>
<b>Fig. 6 Model of traffic pattern</b></p>

<p>All incoming and outgoing traffic patterns are modeled as following vector
data.</p>

<p><img alt="" border="0" src="1f_2g.gif"></p>

<h3><a name="s9">5.2. Correlation the traffic pattern</a></h3>

<p>Traffic pattern correlation is based on correlation coefficient, calculated
as follow. Here, <b><i>A</i></b> is incoming pattern, then <b><i>B</i></b> is
outgoing.</p>

<p><img alt="" border="0" src="1f_2h.gif"></p>

<p>In case that<b><i>r(A,B)</i></b> is close to 1, the traffic <b><i>A</i></b>
went through as traffic <b><i>B</i></b>. One of the advantages of correlation
coefficient is that absolute value of the metric can be neglected. The
difference of size is represented as amplifier rate as follows. Large value of
a means the volume of traffic is amplified a times.</p>

<p><img alt="" border="0" src="1f_2i.gif"></p>

<h3><a name="s10">5.3. Path selection of traffic pattern</a></h3>

<p>By correlation of the traffic pattern, we can determine the direction of
traffic. In Figure 7, a network is showed as bi-directional graph, so each link
can have two patterns at duration, uplink/downlink. When a pattern a observed,
which flowed from <b><i>A</i></b> to <b><i>B</i></b>, the same or amplified
pattern might be observed at <b><i>BD</i></b> or <b><i>BC</i></b>. In such, a
has direction. In this paper, a threshold to correlate patterns is value <b><i>
r &gt; 0.7</i></b>. At that time, the value of a &gt; 2, it represents the
traffic was amplified at node <b><i>B</i></b></p>

<p><img border="0" src="1f_2j.gif" alt="Direction of traffic"><br>
<b>Fig. 7 Direction of traffic</b></p>

<h2><a name="sec.6">6. Experimental evaluation of distributed system for
illegal access</a></h2>

<p>Figure 8 shows our experimental environment. A FDDI loop IX is the target
network, which is monitored by a monitor-PC running TCPDUMP. At the same time,
all links connected to IX have their own RMON [16] like probes, which monitor
the uplinks and downlinks separately. In this paper, all the evaluations are
carried out by comparing results with the complete traffic log captured by
TCPDUMP. Network IX has 25 networks of academic organizations, A to Y.</p>

<b>Fig. 8 Environment of experiment</b></p>

<h3><a name="s11">6.1. SCAN detection</a></h3>

<p>Evaluation was carried out by generating artificial SCANs with random
addresses. In one case TCP-SYN probes, which is a popular way for stealth SCANs
using "normal" probe packets, were generated. In the other case, UDP probe
packets were generated. All probe packets are generated in the network
illustrated in Figure 8.</p>

<h4><a name="s12">SCAN detection with reaction packet</a></h4>

<p>Table 1 shows a result of HTTP service SCANs with TCP-SYN. There are two
types of reactions. One is TCP, the other is ICMP. Totally 1589 probe packets
are generated.</p>

<p>Thirty-four TCP SYN/ACK packets are normal behavior from a HTTP server;
these probes reveal the server/service existence. This type of probe/reaction
pair is normal, making it difficult to monitor the behavior. TCP ACK/RST and
ICMP type 3 (unreachable) packets indicate some error condition, probably
resulting from some mistake somewhere.</p>

<p>In both cases, the number of reaction packets is much smaller than the
number of probe packets. This is a result of filtering by firewall. Many
routers and firewalls are configured to keep silent to the network about
prohibited actions. If they generated a proper message, like "Prohibited by
filtering" [<a href="#ref.15">16</a>], and a security agent intercepted and
collected them, information on scan detection would be enriched.</p>

<h4><a name="s13">Information correlation for distributed SCAN
detection</a></h4>

<p>To evaluate the ability of distributed cooperated SCAN detection, we
collected information on reaction packets from each subnet. In this experiment,
about 1500 hosts were scanned with random address, distributed over 118
subnets.</p>

<p>Figure 9 shows an effect of distributed cooperated SCAN detection. Each mark
indicates the detection of some reaction packets on time-axis. The upper orange
marks represent observed reaction packets on a subnet segment. The lower blue
marks represent all packets detected and collected from all subnet segments. It
is clear that the orange marks are too few to detect SCAN characteristics; but
the aggregated blue marks provide a rich source of information. The result
clearly shows that widely distributed SCAN behavior is nicely and effectively
aggregated by distributed sensors.</p>

<p>Table 7 shows a summary and estimation of influence of above 85 <i>
smurf</i>s. ICMP echo reply packet of <i>smurf</i> attack is generally high
volume, and goes across many networks all over the world. The table shows a
large number of bursty and persistent traffic was generated by <i>smurf</i>
attacks and many networks and hosts are related. Especially, the last row is an
estimation of number of AS-hops between the site used for packet amplification
and the victim. The estimation is based on Internet Routing Registry (IRR)[<a
href="#ref.16">17</a>]. If related sites did share the information, they could
certainly defend their resources effectively.</p>

<h3><a name="s16">6.4. Combination with Network MAP</a></h3>

<p>Attacker tracking across several ISPs or ASs requires connectivity
information; we used the information from IRR. Figure 12 shows a demonstration
of attacker tracking with Internet MAP. A mechanism for sharing connectivity
information and rapid intrusion information results in an effective proactive
defense system.</p>

<h2><a name="sec.7">7. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>Currently, administrators and mangers of network are coordinating, if at
all, at the human level.&nbsp; Thus, the propagation of security information is
slow and constrained. Furthermore, if the administrator/manager does not have
enough knowledge and skills, appropriate reaction may not happen. An automatic
and standard framework for rapid information sharing and coordinated actions is
necessary to supplement that of the manual activities. In this paper, we
proposed a distributed system for Internet-wide illegal access detection. We
have discussed its effectiveness in SCAN detection, attacker tracking, and
cooperative defense. We have carried out experiments with a prototype in an
operational network environment. The results establish the effectiveness and
potential of distributed systems.</p>
