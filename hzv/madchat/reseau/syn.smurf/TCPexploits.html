<h1>TCP Exploits</h1>
<p>Faking a UDP packet is relatively simple. The header of a UDP packet is very
simple due to its connectionless nature. So, you can fill in any IP address you
like and pretend to be somebody else. Faking a TCP connection is much harder.</p>
<h2>Sequence Number Prediction</h2>
<p>TCP exploits are typically based on <a href="#IPexploits">IP spoofing</a>,
and sequence number prediction.&nbsp; In establishing a TCP connection, both the
server and the client generate a sequence number from which they will start
counting the packets transmitted. This sequence number is (should be) generated
at random, and should be hard to predict. However, some implementations of the
TCP/IP protocol make it rather easy to predict this sequence number. The
attacker either sniffs the current SEQ/ACK of the connection, or can
algorithmically predict them.&nbsp; For more on this, read [Steve Bellovin 1989]
and [Brecht Claerhout].</p>
<p>It is worth recalling the TCP details regarding opening and closing of a
connection between two hosts XX and YY.</p>
<p>The TCP protocol uses a 3-way handshake between the two parties to start a
connection.&nbsp; The client starts the process by sending a SYN packet to
synchronize communication. The host then sends one of two answers back to the
visitor; a RST packet resets the connection, thus refusing the request for
service, while an ACK packet acknowledges the request and awaits the client's
first packet.</p>
<p>The TCP flag FIN indicates &quot;no more data from sender&quot;.&nbsp; This
flag is used when closing a connection down the normal way.&nbsp; The receiving
host enters the CLOSE­WAIT state and starts the process of gracefully closing
the connection. Each end of the connection sends a packet with the FIN
flag.&nbsp; The receiver is expected to acknowledge a received FIN packet by
sending a FIN packet.&nbsp; So four packets are used to close a TCP
connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Closing a connection can also be done by using the RST flag. The RST flag of
a TCP packet of a sender indicates to the receiver that a reset should
occur.&nbsp; On receiving this packet, the host enters the CLOSED state and
frees any resource associated with this instance of the connection. The RST
packet is not acknowledged. Any new incoming packet for that connection will be
dropped. The receiver accepts the RST packet provided the sequence number is
correct.</p>
<p>Below, we show the relevant contents of packets of an attack in
progress.&nbsp;&nbsp; Assume that the &quot;sniper&quot; S (on host ZZ) is on
the same subnet as XX. YY need not be on the same subnet.&nbsp; The data portion
of the packets is often irrelevant, so it is dropped.&nbsp; The SEQ and ACK
numbers are in hex.&nbsp; These were obtained by running a sniffer while the
attack was in progress.</p>
<h3>Connection Killing by RST</h3>
<p>The attacker (on host ZZ) is going to wait for packets in a connection
between XX and YY. He will calculate, from YY's ACK packets to XX, the sequence
number for XX's packets, and fire off a bogus RST packet from ZZ (faking to be
XX) to YY.</p>
<p>Here is an actual attack.&nbsp;&nbsp; XX on port 1810 and YY on port 23 are
connected for a while.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Attacker S waits for a packet to get current SEQ/ACK.&nbsp; Several
    packets, as seen by S,&nbsp; are shown below.&nbsp; S is ready to send his
    RST after the very first.<br>
    <br>
    <code>XX.1810-YY.23 SEQ: 57E1F2A6 ACK: B8BD7679 FLAGS: -AP--- Window: 3400<br>
    YY.23-XX.1810 SEQ: B8BD7679 ACK: 57E1F2A8 FLAGS: -AP--- Window: 2238<br>
    XX.1810-YY.23 SEQ: 57E1F2A8 ACK: B8BD767B FLAGS: -A---- Window: 3400<br>
    YY.23-XX.1810 SEQ: B8BD767B ACK: 57E1F2A8 FLAGS: -AP--- Window: 2238<br>
    XX.1810-YY.23 SEQ: 57E1F2A8 ACK: B8BD7691 FLAGS: -A---- Window: 3400</code><br>
  <li>The attacker sends off to YY.23 his RST packets, with source forged as
    XX.1810.&nbsp; His program sent two RST packets. One after the ACK of
    B8BD7679.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reply from YY was:<br>
    <br>
    <code>YY.23-XX.1810 SEQ: B8BD7679 FLAGS: ---R--</code><br>
    <br>
    But this packet arrived much later, in this particular attack, at that
    particular time because of LAN load or whatever.&nbsp; Connection is still
    on.&nbsp; So off goes another RST from the sniper after&nbsp;
    B8BD7691.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reply from YY was:<br>
    <br>
    <code>YY.23-XX.1810 SEQ: B8BD7691 FLAGS: ---R--</code><br>
    <br>
    The second RST from the sniper was the packet that killed the
    connection.&nbsp; The first reset packet has been buffered somewhere on our
    system, because the Ethernet segment was busy when we wanted to send it.
    This is the 'unexpected thing' that happens some times.&nbsp; Here the data
    stream cooled down fast. When it doesn't cool down so fast, the attacker
    could miss his RST (or the connection will be killed a little later than
    when we wanted).
</ol>
<h3>Closing a Connection by FIN</h3>
<p>The attacker constructs a spoofed FIN packet.&nbsp; It will have the correct
SEQ numbers so that it is accepted by one of the two hosts.&nbsp; This host
would believe the (spoofed) sender did not have any data left. Any packets that
may follow would be ignored as bogus. Here is an actual attack</p>
<ol>
  <li>Connection between XX:23 and YY:1072 is running.&nbsp; Sniper (the
    attacking programs name) is started on host ZZ&nbsp; and waits for a packet
    to take action.<br>
    <br>
    <code>XX.23-YY.1072 SEQ: 19C6B98B ACK : 69C5473E FLAGS: -AP--- Window: 3400</code><br>
    <br>
    plus 2 data bytes<br>
  <li>Sniper detected it, and will send a bogus packet (ZZ as YY to XX). Sniper
    sets the SEQ as ACK of above&nbsp; packet. Sniper calculates his ACK as: SEQ
    of above packet + data length of that packet = 19C6B98B + 2 = 19C6B98D.<br>
    <br>
    <code>YY.1072-XX.23 SEQ: 69C5473E ACK: 19C6B98D FLAGS: -A---F Window: 7C00</code><br>
  <li>Host XX to YY: &quot;Okay, you ended the session, so here is my last
    data.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <code>XX.23-YY.1072 SEQ: 19C6B98D ACK: 69C5473E FLAGS: -AP--- Window: 3400
    XX.23-YY.1072 SEQ: 19C6B998 ACK: 69C5473F FLAGS: -A---- Window: 3400<br>
    XX.23-YY.1072 SEQ: 19C6B998 ACK: 69C5473F FLAGS: -A---F Window: 3400</code><br>
  <li>Host XX now has flushed its buffer and sent his turn FIN's the connection.
    Sniper intercepts this packet and now knows the host XX fell for the spoof
    and the killing was a success!
  <li>We impersonated YY, making XX believe we had no further data. But YY
    doesn't know that and continues to send packets.
    <p><code>YY.1072-XX.23 SEQ: 69C5473E ACK: 19C6B98D FLAGS: -A---- Window:
    3750</code></p>
    <p>Host XX has that connection closed, and thus thinks the real packets of
    YY are spoofed (or at least bogus)! So host XX sends some RST packets.</p>
    <p><code>XX.23-YY.1072 SEQ: 19C6B98D FLAGS: ---R--</code><br>
  <li>This goes on for a couple of packets.
</ol>
<h3>The SYN Flood</h3>
<p align="justify">When the TCP protocol was designed, there was no limit set on
the wait after receiving the SYN.&nbsp; Once a TCP session begins (i.e., after
the next packet comes in) each TCP packet has a timeout. If a packet takes too
long, it times out, and eventually, the connection itself will time out, but
because of the way the state transition diagrams were specified so many years
ago, in this particular state of opening the connection, there are no timeouts.
<p>Suppose ZZ initiates a connection to YY but impersonates as though the packet
is from XX. This is the first packet (SYN connection init) of the three-way TCP
handshake. YY replies with the second packet of the handshake, and will now wait
for response from host XX.&nbsp; If&nbsp; the spoofer sends a packet to the
server, the server will send an acknowledgement back to the &quot;real&quot;
client. If host XX is reachable, there is no easy way for ZZ to prevent the
packet from reaching XX. This real client does not know what to do with this
ACK.&nbsp; XX will tell host YY (with a RST) that it did not initiate a
connection. YY concludes it received a bogus packet, and will ignore the SYN,
and normally nothing more will happen with XX. Remember that YY is wholly
unaware of ZZ.&nbsp; So, the spoofer may try to flood the real client XX with
dummy packets at such a rate that its buffers will overflow, and the ACK from
the server will be lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>But suppose host XX is turned off, ZZ some how observed this, and chose to
impersonate XX. Or that the spoofed source IP address that ZZ used looks
legitimate but is not assigned to any real host. So if XX is unreachable, YY has
a rather long wait for the third packet of the handshake.
<p>Also there is no explicit specification in TCP for the number of simultaneous
channels permitted on a given port. The vast majority of systems in the Internet
allow upto1024 simultaneous sessions. Suppose an attacker sends 1024 packets to
such a computer with the SYN bit set to port 80, say.&nbsp; spoofing the source
address so that each packet has a different source host number.&nbsp; After
receving these 1024 packets, the target system will stop listening to that port.
Note that such a packet is about 40 bytes long, so the total amount of traffic
is only 40,960 bytes, taking a few seconds on a modem,&nbsp; or about 1/20 of a
second on&nbsp; T1.&nbsp; That is, one second's worth of packets results in a
system hang.&nbsp; Many systems probably run out of internal space to store the
uncompleted connections before the second passes and crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">This TCP design bug cannot be fixed at the router or using
some add-on product. The only real fix is to modify operating systems so that it
times out on uncompleted TCP sessions.&nbsp; As of June 2000, we do know of such
OS fixes for all major OS including Linux and Windows NT.</p>
<h2>Connection Hijacking</h2>
YY trusts the packets from XX because of its correct SEQ/ACK numbers. So if
there was a way to mess up XX's SEQ/ACK, YY would stop believing XX's real
packets. We could then impersonate to be XX, but using correct SEQ/ACK numbers
from the perspective of YY. This results in ZZ hijacking the connection: host XX
is confused, YY thinks nothing is wrong as ZZ sends 'correct' data to YY. We can
confuse XX's SEQ/ACK numbers as seen by YY by simply inserting a data packet
into the stream at the right moment (ZZ as XX-&gt;YY). YY would accept this
data, and update ACK numbers. XX would continue to send it's old SEQ numbers, as
it's unaware of our spoofed data.&nbsp; Here is an actual attack.
<ol>
  <li>Attacker examines with a sniffer, and sees the port number 2035, and also
    that the user is in an interactive shell via telnet to YY. He starts <code>hijack</code>
    (the programs name) on host ZZ as 'hijack XX 2035 YY'. The following packet
    from XX-&gt;YY is detected.
    <p><code>XX.1040-YY.23 SEQ: 5C8223EA ACK: C34A67F6 FLAGS: -AP--- Window:

    <br>
    (data is irrelevant)
  <li>Now the hijack program on ZZ impersonates XX with further data to YY.&nbsp;
    The hijacker sends some Backspace (0x08) characters and some Enter (0x0A)
    characters to clean up the command line of the user. This may generate some
    error messages back from the shell. But hijack program should&nbsp; handle
    that too.

  <li>The following is the echo of the spoofed data from the server YY.
    <p><code>YY.23-XX.1040 SEQ: C34A67F7 ACK: 5C8223F5 FLAGS: -AP--- Window:

    <br>
    Note that ACK = 5C8223F5 = 5C8223EB + 0A. This is how the hijacker detects
    success.&nbsp; At this point the connection is controlled by the hijacker,
    and XX's SEQ/ACK numbers are completely messed up with respect to YY. At
    this point the real telnet client's session hangs. Most people ignore this
    as a network problem and re-login after a while, accepting the disconnection
    as Murphy's law. Indeed, connection hangs do happen without any spoofing
    involved because of other reasons.
  <li>Hijack will now send the strings of text it wants to be executed. Each
    time a packet arrives at a host out of sequence, the host should answer it
    with correct SEQ/ACK. This provides the hijacker with the certainty that a
    lot of packets are going to be send with correct (and not changing) SEQ/ACK
    numbers.

  <li>The connection between ZZ and XX contnues. Now the hijacker can execute
    more commands.&nbsp; The hijack program must stay on track of SEQ/ACK, and
    eventually FINish the connection.
