i.	Intro

<Intro>

While studying up on for the CCNA I noticed that minimal security related information
is included in most of the Cisco Press books I own with the exception of access-lists
which made my brain fluctuate into the security state of mind since I've long been
interested in security whether its network based, application based or physically.

As I write this I do not intend to create any sort of problems or chaos on anyone's
network nor do I wish anyone else to. I simply wanted to get these thoughts out and if
they've been addressed then please ignore the document entirely. If you'd care to
share any relevant information then I'd gladly appreciate it, and if your intentions
are to create chaos... DIE. Either way this document will introduce some negative
"theories" on how information is passed on a router level based attack scheme as
opposed to the typical push button kiddie (as defined by Gia of Packet Storm) DoS on
the application level right down to the more annoying broadcast floods.

Keep in mind these are only theories and have not been tested very well but I'm more
than sure that someone else with more experience can gather a better infobase on what
I'm trying to convey. Besides I'm sure someone will probably be able to test these
theories since they most likely have more resources than I do at this time.

Just imaging the thought of a TFN/trin00 based DoS client which implements the types
of attacks is something I could imagine popping up in the future, and it doesn't seem
like there are fixes for some. Sure you cuold block some with ingress filtering or
block them via access-lists, but remember: Sometimes overworked Admins forget stuph.
I've included references to some of the places where I've gathered information from
for anyone else who cares to fix this document up, add to it, or reply with a solution.

iii.	OSPF

While I'm still learning I have to wonder about Cisco's use of the Authentication
process. While it may be password based why isn't this the default standard when
routers connect to each other? It should only take an administrator a minute or so
more pre-configuring a list with trusted hosts. Clear Text authentication or MD5.
Obviously key creations should be by default encrypted or did someone somewhere
along the line forget about programs like solsniff and linsniff?

Beginning the thought process on how someone could screw things up. Lets see,
Designated Router is the equivalent of the root router which is whats stated so
lets tamper with this as well as costs on the network and any other illogical
attack I could think of.

Assuming you already know or slightly understand OSPF the following thoughts kept
creeping into mind as a "What If" kind of scenario. Below are some quick
abbreviations of the "What If Program":

DR	Designated Router
RP	Router Priority
RDI	Router Dead Interval
SRC	Source Address
DST	Destination Address
DEV	Ethernet Device
RID	Router ID
SMAC	Source MAC address
DMAC	Destination Mac Address
NHEL	Number of Hello Packets


We'll start off this way for now and if anyone else wants to think of other ways
to include other options such as Link State Updates, Link State Update, Link State
Request feel free to comment to me or some other security forum.

Someone wants to knock off the main Designated Router on a backbone for an unknown
reason, could be a script kiddie, could be a competitor whoever he is he wants it
offline at any cost. We'll call him EvilKiddie who is going to attack
InnocentNetworkNetworks.com's backbone...

Traceroute InnocentNetworkNetworks.com

 1  10.10.1.1 (10.10.1.1)  2.229 ms  2.042 ms  2.148 ms
 2  first.hop.com (10.10.4.1)  24.090 ms  125.044 ms  194.124 ms

 4  backbone.hop.com (10.10.7.1)  30.089 ms  99.225 ms  30.034 ms
 5  backbone.innocentnetworknetworks.com (192.168.4.1)  34.357 ms  30.036 ms  38.909 ms
 6  router1.innocentnetworknetworks.com (192.168.7.2)  34.275 ms  51.586 ms  50.699 ms
 7  router2.innocentnetworknetworks.com (192.168.8.2)  35.135 ms  50.123 ms  49.123 ms
 7  innocentnetworknetworks.com (192.168.9.69)  40.866 ms  60.118 ms  38.865 ms

EvilKiddie sends the DoS... Router1 is the Designated Router on network. Would OSPF
packets from Router2 cause problems by sending non stop HELLO packets with the RDI set
to 1? Being that "Theoretically," Router1 would never get the information back in time
since the RDI is bad and not only that, but it seems Router2's RouterID is now higher
than Router1, shouldn't Router2 now be considered the DR? Weird...

OSPF -DEV e0 -SMAC 0X:00:12:34 DMAC 9F:13:XS:69 -DST 192.168.7.2 -SRC 192.168.8.2 -RID 1 -RP 1 -NHEL 1000000000 -RDI 1

I know of the MD5 Authentication features that are implemented and used between routers...
well Cisco routers to pass on info from router to the next, but have shouldn't Cisco by
default have _NOT_ supported any type of clear text password/key exchanges? Did someone
forget about sniffers on the network? Why wasn't MD5 which is what is being used as the
encryption by default?

So in comes the sniffer:

./sniffer router.host.f00.org | grep PACKETS_WITH_AuType 0
./sniffer router.host.f00.org | grep PACKETS_WITH_AuType 1

down goes the cipher, Voila... OSPF attack. Or the possibility of someone actually
willing to take the time and brute force the password hash it and send the *dirt*
right back up the route? As an administrator you would probably bitch and rant on
but this is after all theory based ;)

So many thoughts so little time.

Lets see the typical environment which throws up a quick network...

Quickly hired admins with little clues. Overworked admins who don't have the time nor
manpower to configure the route path//company_network//etc as secure as it could be.
Brute forcing can be easy in these types of environments.

Easy passwords for easy adminstration...

/* Router.SampleCompany.com */

Possible pw's // note perl comes in handy to parse out every possible character combo
c1scor0uter
<!scOrOuteR
s4mplec0mpany
r0uter$ample

We all know the routines neccessary to brute force or create _semi-decent_ password lists
with well constructed word and character usage. So there should be no need to even go
there on the password scenarios.

These types of questions perplex me so after searching for weeks without a definitive answer
I figured I'd throw these on the table and see other peoples thoughts on the subject and see
if someone were willing to share any relevant links or documents they've found.


to do:

Finish first thoughts on attacks as well as include LSA examples and read up on NBMA things...
Include documented packet captures and have someone test whether or not OSPF based packets
can be forged unto other networks via some sort of datapipe to avoid internal --> external
filtering...


iv.	Routed Information Protocols

15 hop count max?!?!?!

There you go no authentication other than access-lists... Lets detail a recklessly constructed
packet to send bouncing around the route(r(s)) path to see what we can and can't do. Count to
Infinity? RIP Broadcasts which can be a nightmare. OUch.

*Sigh* I wish I had about 3 2500's to test with. I wish someone at Cisco reads this and sends
me some pimp ass Cisco 7000's...

Sample network 
-------------->
bigbadwolf - router4.someco.com - router3.someco.com - router2.someco.com - someco.com
192.1.11.8       10.10.4.1             10.10.7.1            10.10.8.1	    10.10.9.12

RIP Abbreviations:
DN	Dinstance to Net
DST	Destination
NUM	Number (0 = infinite)
RES	Response Packet (type 2)
SRC	Source

10.10.4.1 (192.1.11.8*) -DN 16 -RES -SRC 10.10.4.1 -0 -DST 10.10.7.1

Router4 floods Router3 with information saying: Hey dipshit your passing your
max hopcount!

Holddown Timer killer? Even with Triggered Updates I still think this can be a problem
but then again these are only theories on what I believe will be the new trin00'ish like
nightmare in the future. Kiddies playing with route(s(r/s))

(needs to be finished)

v.	ICMP theories

What if EvilKiddie decided to cut off www.VictimOfDoS.com from the router level via ICMP?
Sure you can ingress filter certain things from entering your network or leaving your network.
But what would happen if EvilKiddie was within that routed network and decided to attack the
router level network by issuing bad ARP or OSPF information? Are routers smart enough to
determine what is right and wrong, what should and shouldn't be done? And how exactly can you
minimize ICMP traffic. Abolish REDIR on the routers? You wish.

EvilKiddie   == 192.168.0.2   0110.1423.5867
VictimOfDoS  == 192.168.0.100 0101.1234.4321
Router       == 192.168.0.0   0221.1123.2234


ARP(EvilKiddie spoofs) 0101.1234.4321 == 127.0.0.1 --> Router (flooded 100 packets per second per se)

Would the ensuing result be something similar to:
Internet Surfer --> lynx VictimOfDoS --> router --> 127.0.0.1

Now being that EvilKiddie is on the same network as VictimOfDoS how would you go about
filtering this type of poisining? Is there a way because I sure as hell have never seen
anything similar.

Redirects

Same scenario, EvilKiddie spoofs traffic to the router as SomeEvilSite with a flurry of
ICMP Redirect packets. Can the router being on the same network filter this traffic to
protect others on the same network from being DoS'ed in this fashion? Same with Parameter
Problem packets, Destination Unreachable, and Time Exceeded ICMP packets. How can you stop
something like this from totally screwing up your network in a time efficient manner. Or
if I am mistaken kick me and call me JP. Is this also possible to filter on an incoming
level, whereas EvilKiddie was not on your network but sending these types of packets?

Of course I could've used 7F:00:00:01 and correct values but I didn't feel like it since
after all it is "theory-based" so please excuse my bad habits.

Anyways I don't feel like tossing out more as far as ICMP are concerned since most people
will most likely see what I'm trying to convey and either flame me for not looking to
deeply and see these attacks are either, impossible, have been addressed, a figment of my
imagination, etc. But if they haven't then I wouldn't want to give some "EvilKiddie" any
more ideas than I already have.

(needs to be finished)

vi.	Counter Measures

Please bare with me as I am after all still studying some of these theories and how to block
most of the abovementioned attack scenarios.

Mainly filtering via access lists should stop most of the attacks with the exception of
trusted traffic, that being traffic on your network. Now for some errat(a)ic reason many
administrators forget about internal traffic and pass on the notion that users on their
networks are all good old boys/girls/*its* who would never attempt to do something so
dreaded as to sending Denials of Service attacks from their own networks which is not
the case. Hey its a mad mad mad mad world.

(will finish soon... too tired to type)
