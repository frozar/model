>,
the kind of answers you get to your technical questions depends as much
on the way you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the
answer.  This guide will teach you how to ask questions in a way that
is likely to get you a satisfactory answer.</P
><P
>The first thing to understand is that hackers actually like hard
problems and good, thought-provoking questions about them.  If we
didn't, we wouldn't be here.  If you give us an interesting question
to chew on we'll be grateful to you; good questions are a stimulus and
a gift.  Good questions help us develop our understanding, and often
reveal problems we might not have noticed or thought about otherwise.
Among hackers, "Good question!" is a strong and sincere compliment.</P
><P
>Despite this, hackers have a reputation for meeting simple
questions with what looks like hostility or arrogance.  It sometimes
looks like we're reflexively rude to newbies and the ignorant.  But
this isn't really true.</P
><P
>What we are, unapologetically, is hostile to people who seem to be
unwilling to think or do their own homework before asking
questions.  People like that are time sinks &#8212; they take without
giving back, they waste time we could have spent on another question
more interesting and another person more worthy of an answer.  We call
people like this "losers" (and for historical reasons we sometimes
spell it "lusers").</P
><P
>We realize that there are many people who just want to use the
software we write, and have no interest in learning technical
details. For most people, a computer is merely a tool, a means to an
end; they have more important things to do and lives to live.  We
acknowledge that, and don't expect everyone to take an interest in the
technical matters that fascinate us.  Nevertheless, our style of
answering questions is tuned for people who <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>do</I
>
take such an interest and are willing to be active participants in
problem-solving.  That's not going to change.  Nor should it; if it
did, we would become less effective at the things we do best.</P
><P
>We're (largely) volunteers.  We take time out of busy lives to
answer questions, and at times we're overwhelmed with them.  So we
filter ruthlessly.  In particular, we throw away questions from people
who appear to be losers in order to spend our question-answering time
more efficiently, on winners.</P
><P
>If you find this attitude obnoxious, condescending, or arrogant,
check your assumptions.  We're not asking you to genuflect to us
&#8212; in fact, most of us would love nothing more than to deal with
you as an equal and welcome you into our culture, if you put in the
effort required to make that possible.  But it's simply not efficient
for us to try to help people who are not willing to help themselves.
If you can't live with this sort of discrimination, we suggest you pay
somebody for a commercial support contract instead of asking hackers
to personally donate help to you.</P
><P
>If you decide to come to us for help, you don't want to be one
of the losers.  You don't want to seem like one, either.  The best way
to get a rapid and responsive answer is to ask it like a winner
&#8212; to ask it like a person with smarts, confidence, and clues who
just happens to need help on one particular problem.</P

eliciting useful answers in a technical forum.)</P

><P
>When you ask your question, display the fact that you have done
these things first; this will help establish that you're not being a
lazy sponge and wasting people's time.  Better yet, display what you have
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>learned</I
> from doing these things.  We like answering
questions for people who have demonstrated that they can learn from
the answers.</P
><P
>Prepare your question.  Think it through.  Hasty-sounding
questions get hasty answers, or none at all.  The more you do to 
demonstrate that you have put thought and effort into solving
your problem before asking for help, the more likely you are to
actually get help.</P
><P
>Beware of asking the wrong question.  If you ask one that is
based on faulty assumptions, J. Random Hacker is quite likely to reply
with a uselessly literal answer while thinking "Stupid question...",
and hoping that the experience of getting what you asked for rather
than what you needed will teach you a lesson.</P
><P
>Never assume you are <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>entitled</I
> to an answer.
You are not; you aren't, after all, paying for the service.  You will
earn an answer, if you earn it, by asking a question that is
substantial, interesting, and thought-provoking &#8212; one that
implicitly contributes to the experience of the community rather than
merely passively demanding knowledge from others.</P
><P
>On the other hand, making it clear that you are able and willing
to help in the process of developing the solution is a very good
start. "Can someone provide a pointer?", "What is my example
missing?" and "Is there a site I should have checked?" are more likely
to get answered than "Please post the exact procedure I should use."
because you're making it clear that you're truly willing to complete
the process if someone can simply point you in the right
direction.</P

>In general, questions to a well-selected public forum are more
likely to get useful answers than equivalent questions to a private
one.  There are multiple reasons for this.  One is simply the size of
the pool of potential respondents.  Another is the size of the
audience; hackers would rather answer questions that educate a lot of
people than questions which only serve a few.</P

>Whenever possible, use project mailing lists</A
></H2
><P
>When a project has a development mailing list, write to the
mailing list, not to individual developers, even if you believe that
you know who can answer your question best.  Check the documentation
of the project and its homepage for the address of a project mailing
list, and use it.  There are several good reasons for this
policy:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Any question that's good enough to be asked of one
developer will also be of value to the whole group.  Contrariwise, if
you think that your question is too dumb for a mailing list, it's not
an excuse to harass individual developers.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Asking questions on the list distributes load between
developers.  The individual developer (especially if he's the project
leader) may be too busy to answer your questions.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Most mailing lists are archived and the archives are
indexed by search engines.  Somebody could find your question and the
answer on the web instead of asking it again in the list.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>If certain questions are seen to be asked often, the
developers can use that information to improve the documentation or the
software itself to be less confusing.  But if those questions are
asked in private, nobody has the complete picture of what questions
are asked most often.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>If you cannot find a project's mailing list address, but only
see the address of the maintainer of the project, go ahead and write
to the maintainer.  But even in that case, don't assume that the
mailing list doesn't exist.  State in your e-mail that you tried and
could not find the appropriate mailing list.  Also mention that you
don't object to having your message forwarded to other people.  (Many
people believe that private e-mail should remain private, even if
there is nothing secret in it.  By allowing your message to be
forwarded you give your correspondent a choice about how to handle
your e-mail.)</P

>Write in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language</A
></H2
><P
>We've found by experience that people who are careless and
sloppy writers are usually also careless and sloppy at thinking and
coding (often enough to bet on, anyway). Answering questions for
careless and sloppy thinkers is not rewarding; we'd rather spend our
time elsewhere.</P
><P
>So expressing your question clearly and well is important.  If
you can't be bothered to do that, we can't be bothered to pay
attention.  Spend the extra effort to polish your language.  It
doesn't have to be stiff or formal &#8212; in fact, hacker culture
values informal, slangy and humorous language used with precision.
But it has to <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>be</I
> precise; there has to be some
indication that you're thinking and paying attention.</P
><P
>Spell, punctuate, and capitalize correctly.  Don't confuse "its"
with "it's" or "loose" with "lose".  Don't TYPE IN ALL CAPS, this is
read as shouting and considered rude. (All-smalls is only slightly
less annoying, as it's difficult to read.  Alan Cox can get away with
it, but you can't.)</P
><P
>More generally, if you write like a semi-literate boob you will
very likely be ignored.  Writing like a l33t script kiddie hax0r is
the absolute kiss of death and guarantees you will receive nothing but
stony silence (or, at best, a heaping helping of scorn and sarcasm) in
return.</P
><P
>If you are asking questions in a forum that does not use your
native language, you will get a limited amount of slack for spelling
and grammar errors &#8212; but no extra slack at all for laziness (and
yes, we can usually spot that difference).  Also, unless you know what
your respondent's languages are, write in English.  Busy hackers tend
to simply flush questions in languages they don't understand, and
English is the working language of the Internet.  By writing in
English you minimize your chances that your question will be discarded
unread.</P

discarded by reflex).  Don't try to impress us with the
depth of your anguish; use the space for a super-concise problem
description instead.</P

organizations, is "object - deviation". The "object" part specifies 
what thing or group of things is having a problem, and the "deviation"

>Hackers believe solving problems should be a public, transparent
process during which a first try at an answer can and should be
corrected if someone more knowledgeable notices that it is incomplete or
incorrect.  Also, they get some of their reward for being
respondents from being seen to be competent and knowledgeable by
their peers.</P

&#8212; and if he does, it's usually because he thinks the question is
too ill-formed or obvious to be interesting to others.</P

the question is such that you are likely to get a lot of answers that
are all pretty similar, then the magic words are "email me and I'll

are also the busiest people (if only because they take on the most
work themselves).  People like that are allergic to open-ended time
sinks, thus they tend to be allergic to open-ended questions.</P
><P
>You are more likely to get a useful response if you are
explicit about what you want respondents to do (provide pointers,
send code, check your patch, whatever).  This will focus their 
effort and implicitly put an upper bound on the time and energy 
a respondent has to put in to helping you.  This is good.</P

as an abundant resource and time to respond as a scarce one.  The less

to get an answer from someone really good and really busy.</P

>So it is useful to frame your question to minimize the time
commitment required for an expert to field it &#8212; but this is often 
not the same thing as simplifying the question.  Thus, for example,
"Can you give me a pointer to a good explanation of X?" is usually 
a smarter question than "Would you explain X, please?".  If you have
some code that isn't working, it is usually smarter to ask for someone
to explain what's wrong with it than it is to ask someone to fix it.</P

intended to give offence.  Rather, it's the product of the direct,
cut-through-the-bullshit communications style that is natural to
people who are more concerned about solving problems than making
others feel warm and fuzzy.</P
><P
>When you perceive rudeness, try to react calmly.  If someone
is really acting out, it is very likely that a senior person on the
list or newsgroup or forum will call him or her on it.  If that 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>doesn't</I
> happen and you lose your temper, it
is likely that the person you lose it at was behaving within the
hacker community's norms and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>you</I
> will be
considered at fault.  This will hurt your chances of getting the
information or help you want.</P
><P
>On the other hand, you will occasionally run across rudeness and
posturing that is quite gratuitous.  The flip-side of the above is
that it is acceptable form to slam real offenders quite hard,
dissecting their misbehavior with a sharp verbal scalpel.  Be very,
very sure of your ground before you try this, however.  The line
between correcting an incivility and starting a pointless flamewar is thin
enough that hackers themselves not infrequently blunder across it; if
you are a newbie or an outsider, your chances of avoiding such a
blunder are low.  If you're after information rather than entertainment,
it's better to keep your fingers off the keyboard than to risk this.</P

>(Some people assert that many hackers have a mild form of autism
or Asperger's Syndrome, and are actually missing some of the brain
circuitry that lubricates `normal' human social interaction.  This may
or may not be true.  If you are not a hacker yourself, it may help you
cope with our eccentricities if you think of us as being
brain-damaged.  Go right ahead.  We won't care; we

to insist you've been personally insulted when someone comments that
one of your claims was wrong, or that his views differ.  Those are
loser attitudes.</P
><P
>There have been hacker forums where, out of some misguided sense of
hyper-courtesy, participants are banned from posting any fault-finding
with another's posts, and told "Don't say anything if you're unwilling
to help the user."  The resulting departure of clueful participants to

to ignore you and filter you out of his life.  If you can't manage to be
grateful, at least have a little dignity, don't whine, and don't expect

I tried X, Y, and Z on the S2464 motherboard.  When that didn't work,
I tried A, B, and C.  Note the curious symptom when I tried C.

time by telling them the blind alleys I had already run down.</P
