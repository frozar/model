    <blockquote>
      <p>I know this is a very controversial topic but I am writing this anyway.&nbsp; 
      There are lots people that have questions about breaking directories.&nbsp; 
      Hopefully the only people this are the people seeking to reclaim their 
      data on a pub or clean up old tags.&nbsp; Please do not use this 
      information to steal pubs and/or delete other peoples pubs (unless it is 
      really old stuff, check file dates).&nbsp; There are currently three ways 
      to break directories that I know of.&nbsp; With the information on this 
      page you should be able to get into almost any directory created, 
      excluding some UNIX locked folder with ÿ in them.</p>
      <p>If you are having problems with certain directories not working see the
      <a href="#prob">When Problems Occur</a> section below.</p>
      <p>Obviously I did not discover all this information myself, actually none 
      of it.&nbsp; Most of it came from the
      <a href="http://www.netknowledgebase.com/">NKB</a> (Net Knowledge Base).&nbsp; 
      The credit for most of this goes towards hawk, with the exception of the 
      peeking method which goodslw and sung1st came up with.&nbsp; I simply took 
      all the information I found and compiled it into a easy to read tutorial.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the most basic and easy method to break directories.&nbsp; But 
      it can only break simple locked directories such as &quot;locked / /&quot; and it 
      will not work on directories mad with reserved words or otherwise illegal 
      directory names.</p>
      <p>All you need to do is right click and select &quot;Make Folder&quot; and input 
      the name of the folder without the &quot; / /&quot; at the end.&nbsp; After it 
      refreshes the listing you can now double click the locked folder (check 
      the timestamp for the older one) and enter it easily.&nbsp; Easy isn't it?&nbsp; 
      Don't expect to find many directories that this works on.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="tutsec"><a name="ren"></a>Renaming</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is most useful for cleaning out old tags and also can be used if 
      you want to unlock/change your own path.&nbsp; For this we will make a 
      custom command in FlashFXP because it's a lot easier and takes less 
      clicking to do the steps.&nbsp; To setup custom commands go to the menu 
      Commands -&gt; Edit Command... (or just press F7).&nbsp; While the &quot;Custom 
      Commands&quot; folder is selected click the &quot;Add Cmd&quot; button at the bottom.&nbsp; 
      For the name put something like &quot;Rename File/Dir&quot; and inside the Command 
      window put the following:</p>
      <p>rnfr %d[Name of Dir/File]<br>
      rnto %d[New Name]</p>
      <p>You can now press OK to close the dialog.&nbsp; When this command is 
      run FlashFXP will prompt for the current name and then the new name.</p>
      <p>To use this to unlock a folder get in a directory with a locked folder.&nbsp; 
      To find the exact name of the folder we will use RAW Directory listing.&nbsp; 
      Click Directory -&gt; View RAW Directory and it will bring up a text display 
      of all the directories.&nbsp; Find the directory you want to unlock and 
      select from the point where all the directories are to end of that line 
      and then copy this selection.&nbsp; This will capture all the proceeding 
      and trailing spaces in the folder name.&nbsp; What appears to be &quot;com1&quot; 
      could actually be: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; com1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      &quot;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Now with that copied Click Commands and then the new custom command we 
      made.&nbsp; In the first dialog that pops up enter in the following: 
      &quot;./&lt;Paste Dir Name&gt;/ /&quot;&nbsp; If there are not spaces before the letters 
      of the folder name the &quot;./&quot; at the beginning is not necessary.&nbsp; On 
      the next dialog you can put in whatever you want to rename the folder to, 
      this can also be another locked folder (if you know the next folder in the 
      path you can change your own locks this way).&nbsp; Now if you select the 
      remote FTP window and press F5 (Refresh) your new folder name should be 
      visible.&nbsp; If you unlocked a folder you can now enter it normally.</p>

    <p class="tutsec"><a name="peek"></a>Peeking</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>With this technique you can see inside locked folders with a special 
      list command.&nbsp; This technique is useful for retrieving your data if 
      someone moves it and locks folders.&nbsp; Do not use this information to 
      steal other peoples work.&nbsp; I find the easiest way to do this is by 
      again making a custom command in FlashFXP.&nbsp; This time name the 
      command &quot;Peek Locked Folder&quot; and put the following as the command:</p>
      <p>cwd %d[Enter Locked Folder]<br>
      list -alF ../*/</p>
      <p>Here is an explanation (from hawk) of the switches used on the list 
      command:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>-a include files and directories that begin with a dot (.). These 
        are normally hidden files. </li>
        <li>-F label directories with a trailing slash (/), executables with a 
        trailing asterisk (*), and links with a trailing at-sign (@) </li>
        <li>-l gives a long listing which includes access permissions, owner, 
        group, size in bytes, and time of last modification</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I think the options I use give the most information, if you want to 
      omit any feel free to do so.&nbsp; Once you have the custom command setup 
      how you want click ok and get a place with a locked folder.</p>
      <p>We are again need the full directory name like in the previous section, 
      so use the RAW Directories to copy the full pathname.&nbsp; Select the new 
      custom command and input the path as in the previous section as well.&nbsp; 
      The command will then switch to this directory and do the custom list 
      command we have made and should show you all the folders inside of it.&nbsp; 
      If you think there might be spaces before the folder name you can use the 
      RAW Directories to get the full name.&nbsp; If the folder you want to 
      access is not locked we can no enter it by typing the path into the path 
      bar on the top.&nbsp; Double clicking the folder will not work because of 
      the way we tricked the server into listing the folders.&nbsp; If you still 
      have the first patch copied you can paste it into the path bar followed by 
      just a &quot;/&quot; and then type in the folder you see in the listing (or copy 
      paste from RAW Directories listing).&nbsp; Press enter and it should enter 
      the folder.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="tutsec"><a name="remove"></a>Removing Directories</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Well once you have gotten the full path of a directory structure you 
      can remove it just so long nothing is in use inside the folders.&nbsp; 
      This is a good practice if you find lots of old tags and junk on a Pub to 
      clean it up.&nbsp; It will make your tag more noticeable (because its the 
      only one) and also if a Sysop happened to view his directories he is less 
      likely to notice one extra folder instead of the usual 10 locked folders 
      you find on many pubs.</p>
      <p>Removing the directories is very simple once you can get inside the 
      path.&nbsp; The easiest thing to do is to rename all the locked folders 
      you come across (or any folders FlashFXP has problems entering normally).&nbsp; 
      Then once they are all renamed go back to the first folder of the 
      directory maze and delete the main dir.&nbsp; FlashFXP will then ask you 
      if your sure, say yes, then it will tell you that deleting this folder 
      will delete all nested subfolders and files, say yes again. FlashFXP will 
      now begin going through all the directories and deleting any files it 
      finds, once it determines all the folders are empty it will remove all the 
      folders.&nbsp; The main folder should now be gone, if it ran into errors 
      look at see what it had problems with.&nbsp; Remember to look for 
      invisible directories because if they are in a folder FlashFXP can't 
      remove them unless you rename them first.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="tutsec"><a name="prob"></a>When Problems Occur</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In some cases folders will not want to unlock/delete and FlashFXP will 
      complain about some error or another.&nbsp; First thing to do is check the 
      RAW listing, most cases problems occur because of extra spaces you did not 
      notice.&nbsp; Also look for &quot;invisible&quot; folders, which are folders the 
      consist only of spaces.&nbsp; FlashFXP will usually not show them in the 
      directory listing but will show then in the RAW listing.&nbsp; If you are 
      still having problems it could be a folder that FlashFXP itself has 
      problems with.&nbsp; If you think this may be the case go download
      <a href="http://www.bitbeamer.com">BitBeamer</a> and try it on the 
      directory.&nbsp; You wont have the custom command in here but you can 
      enter RAW Commands and use the same format as the Custom command but 
      replace %d[Whatever] with the folder names.&nbsp; Each line must be sent 
      individually when using RAW Commands.</p>
      <p>If you are getting access denied on renaming folders it is usually 
      because somewhere inside the folder someone is downloading/uploading 
      something.&nbsp; You can try back later or use the <a href="#peek">Peeking</a> 
      technique to see inside the folder.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="tutsec"><a name="close"></a>Closing Notes</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>As I said in the beginning I know that a lot of people may be disgusted 
      that I wrote this tutorial and say that I'm just helping deleters.&nbsp; 
      Well they would find out one way or another anyway, especially with NKB 
      (there's way more stuff there).&nbsp; I hope I don't make any enemies with 
      this one, it should answer a lot of legitimate questions that people may 
      have.&nbsp; Also please respect other groups/peoples work and leave their 
      tags alone if they are current.&nbsp; Pub stealing and deleting is about 
      as low as you can go, you don't want to go there.</p>
