    <blockquote>
      <p>Like all dir locking and breaking it is never really more advanced, 
      when you know what to do it is really very simple. So this tutorial is not 
      actually advanced, I’d say it is more precise. It concentrates on one OS 
      and technique in particular. We will concentrate on one character that is 
      fantastic for making locked dirs on UNIX boxes.</p>
      <p>I’ve picked up most of this information on
      <a href="http://www.netknowledgebase.com">Net Knowledge Base</a>. It is a 
      fantastic forum with extremely friendly members. By either asking the 
      questions myself, reading others questions or reading the tutorials posted 
      I have compiled this information. I wrote it all out in my own words to 
      avoid any plagiarism and create a tutorial similar in style to the ones 
      previously posted on this site.</p>

    <p class="tutsec"><a name="start"></a>Getting Started</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>First thing you need is a good pub to test stuff out on. In this 
      tutorial we will be working with a UNIX. So head over to your local FXP 
      board and find a UNIX pub. Since UNIX and NT have different file systems, 
      locking directories on NT is completely different and is covered in
      <a href="dirnt.htm">Dir Locking - NT Basics</a>. Once you have a pub, load 
      FlashFXP and connect to it, then go to the pub directory, this is where 
      you have access to create and remove directories and files.</p>
      <p>*NOTE: Turn on logging in FlashFXP. This will make it a lot easier to 
      break your locked dirs and help you remember how many special 
      characters/spaces you have used.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="tutsec"><a name="esc"></a>The Escape Character</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>*NOTE: In this section all directory names can be replaced with 
      whatever you want unless otherwise specified. The special characters are 
      what's important, not the folder names.</p>
      <p>If you hold down [Alt] and press [1] then [5] then [2] (not all at 
      once) this character will appear: <b>ÿ</b>.&nbsp; This is referred to as 
      [Alt+152].&nbsp; In case you're not familiar with Alt keystrokes, you must 
      use the numpad (numbers on the right side of the keyboard) when doing 
      these commands.</p>
      <p>*NOTE: If you are having problems where Alt+152 is not doing anything 
      try Alt+0255.&nbsp; I have had reports where in some non-US character sets 
      152 does NOT work but 0255 does.</p>
      <p>This is the magical character. On NT machines this does nothing, it is 
      just like any other character. However, on UNIX machines <b>ÿ</b> is an 
      escape character.</p>
      <p>There are three variations of ways this character can be handled. These 
      three different outcomes depend on the type of UNIX the server is running 
      on. They may all be UNIX Type L8 but may just be off a different build 
      with different settings. You will just have to experiment. There are 
      possibilities I missed so you will probably find slight variations.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Now you should be realizing why this is a powerful tool for locking 
      dirs on UNIX. The <b>ÿ</b> character, excuse my French, fucks everything 
      up. Folders display completely differently from what you initially 
      inputted and thus makes it difficult to change unless the initial 
      directory is known. Take that deleters!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="tutsec"><a name="using"></a>Using Your Protected Path</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This character is weird and different machines with different builds of 
      UNIX respond differently. On some machines you will be able to upload and 
      download perfectly from your protected path. If this is the case you can 
      ignore this section until you stumble upon a different machine.</p>
      <p>You might not be able to upload directly to your protected path, in 
      that case, upload your stuff to another unprotected folder then when it is 
      finished just move your uploaded files into your protected path.</p>
      <p>Secondly, you might be able to download files from the protected path 
      but you may not be able to download any of the folders within it. So in 
      your post make sure to specify to only download the files and not the 
      folders they reside in.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="tutsec"><a name="breaking"></a>Breaking Your Protected Path</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>To change your amazing new protected path you have to use the rnfr/rnto 
      raw commands. Click on Commands then go to Raw Command (quote). Enter 
      “rnfr /your/original/protected/path” then go to Raw Command (quote) again 
      and this time enter “rnto /your/new/unprotected/path”.</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>rnfr /tag/ÿÿÿ404ÿÿÿ/fxp</li>
        <li>rnto /tag/404/fxp</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You should have no trouble renaming it as long as what you enter the 
      first time is exactly what you entered to create your original protected 
      path. That is why it is a good idea to make sure u have your FTP client 
      creating a log file of your actions (FlashFXP logs your actions to 
      “FlashFXP.log” in the FlashFXP installation folder).</p>

    <p class="tutsec"><a name="closing"></a>Closing Notes</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>If you are getting access denied when trying to remove directories, 
      whether they are locked or not, it is usually because there is something 
      still in the folder or your not entering the right number of <b>ÿ</b>’s.&nbsp;For 
      files if you're getting access denied it is because the file is in use, 
      either being uploaded or downloaded. If you have made sure your folder is 
      empty then you might not be able to remove it because someone may be in 
      it. In that case you will just have to play the waiting game.</p>
