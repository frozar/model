35.1.2 Conventions</A>

<P>
A constant-width font is used for displaying the names of files and
directories.

<P>
Components of filenames that vary are represented by a description of
the contents enclosed in "<TT>&#60;</TT>" and "<TT>&#62;</TT>" characters,
<TT>&#60;thus&#62;</TT>.  Electronic mail addresses are also enclosed in "&#60;" and
"&#62;" but are shown in the usual typeface.

<P>
Optional components of filenames are enclosed in "<TT>[</TT>" and
"<TT>]</TT>" characters and may be combined with the "<TT>&#60;</TT>" and
"<TT>&#62;</TT>" convention.  For example, if a filename is allowed to occur
either with or without an extension, it might be represented by
<TT>&#60;filename&#62;[.&#60;extension&#62;]</TT>.

<P>
Variable substrings of directory names and filenames are indicated by
"<TT>*</TT>".

<H1><A NAME="SECTION003820000000000000000">
35.2 The Filesystem</A>
</H1>

<P>
This standard assumes that the operating system underlying an
FHS-compliant file system supports the same basic security features
found in most U<SMALL>NIX</SMALL> filesystems.

<P>
It is possible to define two independent categories of files: shareable
vs. unshareable and variable vs. static.  There should be a simple and
easily understandable mapping from directories to the type of data they contain: directories
may be mount points for other filesystems with different characteristics
from the filesystem on which they are mounted.

<P>
Shareable data is that which can be shared between several different
hosts; unshareable is that which must be specific to a particular host.
For example, user home directories are shareable data, but device lock
files are not.

<P>
Static data includes binaries, libraries, documentation, and anything
that does not change without system administrator intervention; variable
data is anything else that does change without system administrator
intervention.

<UL>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE="-1">BEGIN RATIONALE</FONT></B>
</LI>
<LI>The distinction between shareable and unshareable data is needed for
several reasons:

<UL>
<LI>In a networked environment (i.e., more than one host at a site), there
is a good deal of data that can be shared between different hosts to
save space and ease the task of maintenance.
</LI>
<LI>In a networked environment, certain files contain information specific
to a single host.  Therefore these filesystems cannot be shared
(without taking special measures).
</LI>
<LI>Historical implementations of U<SMALL>NIX</SMALL>-like filesystems interspersed
shareable and unshareable data in the same hierarchy, making it
difficult to share large portions of the filesystem.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The "shareable" distinction can be used to support, for example:

<UL>
<LI>A <TT>/usr</TT> partition (or components of <TT>/usr</TT>) mounted
(read-only) through the network (using NFS).
</LI>
<LI>A <TT>/usr</TT> partition (or components of <TT>/usr</TT>) mounted from
read-only media.  A CD-ROM is one copy of many identical ones
distributed to other users by the postal mail system and other methods.
It can thus be regarded as a read-only filesystem shared with other
FHS-compliant systems by some kind of "network".
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The "static" versus "variable" distinction affects the filesystem in two
major ways:

<UL>
<LI>Since <TT>/</TT> contains both variable and static data, it needs to be mounted
read-write.
</LI>
<LI>Since the traditional <TT>/usr</TT> contains both variable and static data, and
since we may want to mount it read-only (see above), it is necessary to
provide a method to have <TT>/usr</TT> mounted read-only.  This is done through
the creation of a <TT>/var</TT> hierarchy that is mounted read-write (or is a
part of another read-write partition, such as <TT>/)</TT>, taking over much of
the <TT>/usr</TT> partition's traditional functionality.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Here is a summarizing chart.  This chart is only an example for a common
FHS-compliant system, other chart layouts are possible within
FHS-compliance.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION003831000000000000000">
35.3.1 Purpose</A>
</H2>
The contents of the root filesystem must be adequate to boot, restore,
recover, and/or repair the system.

<UL>
<LI>To boot a system, enough must be present on the root partition to mount
other filesystems.  This includes utilities, configuration, boot loader
information, and other essential start-up data.  <TT>/usr</TT>,
<TT>/opt</TT>, and <TT>/var</TT> are designed such that they may be
located on other partitions or filesystems.
</LI>
<LI>To enable recovery and/or repair of a system, those utilities needed by
an experienced maintainer to diagnose and reconstruct a damaged system
must be present on the root filesystem.
</LI>
<LI>To restore a system, those utilities needed to restore from system
backups (on floppy, tape, etc.) must be present on the root
filesystem.
</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE="-1">BEGIN RATIONALE</FONT></B>
</LI>
<LI><P>
The primary concern used to balance these considerations, which favor
placing many things on the root filesystem, is the goal of keeping
root as small as reasonably possible.  For several reasons, it is
desirable to keep the root filesystem small:

<UL>
<LI>It is occasionally mounted from very small media.
</LI>
<LI>The root filesystem contains many system-specific configuration files.
Possible examples include a kernel that is specific to the system, a
specific hostname, etc.  This means that the root filesystem isn't
always shareable between networked systems.  Keeping it small on servers
in networked systems minimizes the amount of lost space for areas of
unshareable files.  It also allows workstations with smaller local hard
drives.
</LI>
<LI>While you may have the root filesystem on a large partition, and may be
able to fill it to your heart's content, there will be people with
smaller partitions.  If you have more files installed, you may find
incompatibilities with other systems using root filesystems on smaller
partitions.  If you are a developer then you may be turning your
assumption into a problem for a large number of users.
</LI>
<LI>Disk errors that corrupt data on the root filesystem are a greater
problem than errors on any other partition.  A small root filesystem is
less prone to corruption as the result of a system crash.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Software must never create or require special files or subdirectories
in the root directory.  Other locations in the FHS hierarchy provide
more than enough flexibility for any package.

<P>
There are several reasons why introducing a new subdirectory of the root
filesystem is prohibited:

<UL>
<LI>It demands space on a root partition which the system administrator may
want kept small and simple for either performance or security reasons.
</LI>
<LI>It evades whatever discipline the system administrator may have set up
for distributing standard file hierarchies across mountable volumes.

occasionally use must still be placed in <TT>/usr/bin</TT>.
<TT>ping</TT>, although it is absolutely necessary for root (network
recovery and diagnosis) is often used by users and must live in
<TT>/bin</TT> for that reason.

<P>
We recommend that users have read and execute permission for everything
in <TT>/sbin</TT> except, perhaps, certain setuid and setgid programs.
The division between <TT>/bin</TT> and <TT>/sbin</TT> was not created for
security reasons or to prevent users from seeing the operating system,
but to provide a good partition between binaries that everyone uses and
ones that are primarily used for administration tasks.  There is no
inherent security advantage in making <TT>/sbin</TT> off-limits for
users.

<P>
The component <TT>&#60;section&#62;</TT> describes the manual section.

<P>
Provisions must be made in the structure of <TT>/usr/share/man</TT> to support
manual pages which are written in different (or multiple) languages.
These provisions must take into account the storage and reference of
these manual pages.  Relevant factors include language (including
geographical-based differences), and character code set.

<P>
This naming of language subdirectories of <TT>/usr/share/man</TT> is based on
Appendix E of the POSIX 1003.1 standard which describes the locale
identification string -- the most well-accepted method to describe a
cultural environment.  The <TT>&#60;locale&#62;</TT> string is:

<UL>
<LI><TT>&#60;language&#62;[_&#60;territory&#62;][.&#60;character-set&#62;][,&#60;version&#62;]</TT>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The <TT>&#60;language&#62;</TT> field must be taken from ISO 639 (a code for the
representation of names of languages).  It must be two characters wide
and specified with lowercase letters only.

<P>
The <TT>&#60;territory&#62;</TT> field must be the two-letter code of ISO 3166
(a specification of representations of countries), if possible.  (Most
people are familiar with the two-letter codes used for the country codes
in email addresses.<FONT COLOR="#ffa500">(footnote follows)</FONT>) It must be two characters wide and specified
with uppercase letters only.
 <FONT COLOR="#ffa500">[A major exception to this rule is the United Kingdom, which is `GB' in
the ISO 3166, but `UK' for most email addresses.
]</FONT>
<P>
The <TT>&#60;character-set&#62;</TT> field must represent the standard
describing the character set.  If the <TT>&#60;character-set&#62;</TT> field is
just a numeric specification, the number represents the number of the
international standard describing the character set.  It is recommended
that this be a numeric representation if possible (ISO standards,
especially), not include additional punctuation symbols, and that any
letters be in lowercase.

<P>
A parameter specifying a <TT>&#60;version&#62;</TT> of the profile may be placed
after the <TT>&#60;character-set&#62;</TT> field, delimited by a comma.  This
may be used to discriminate between different cultural needs; for
instance, dictionary order versus a more systems-oriented collating
order.  This standard recommends not using the <TT>&#60;version&#62;</TT> field,
unless it is necessary.

<P>
Systems which use a unique language and code set for all manual pages
may omit the <TT>&#60;locale&#62;</TT> substring and store all manual pages in
<TT>&#60;mandir&#62;</TT>.  For example, systems which only have English manual
pages coded with ASCII, may store manual pages (the
<TT>man&#60;section&#62;</TT> directories) directly in <TT>/usr/share/man</TT>.
(That is the traditional circumstance and arrangement, in fact.)

<P>
Countries for which there is a well-accepted standard character code set
may omit the <TT>&#60;character-set&#62;</TT> field, but it is strongly
recommended that it be included, especially for countries with several
competing standards.

<P>
Various examples:

\end{longtable}">
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Similarly, provision must be made for manual pages which are
architecture-dependent, such as documentation on device-drivers or
low-level system administration commands.  These must be placed under an
<TT>&#60;arch&#62;</TT> directory in the appropriate <TT>man&#60;section&#62;</TT> directory;
for example, a man page for the i386 ctrlaltdel(8) command might be
placed in <TT>/usr/share/man/&#60;locale&#62;/man8/i386/ctrlaltdel.8</TT>.

<P>
Manual pages for commands and data under <TT>/usr/local</TT> are stored
in <TT>/usr/local/man</TT>.  Manual pages for X11R6 are
stored in <TT>/usr/X11R6/man</TT>.  It follows that all manual page
hierarchies in the system must have the same structure as
<TT>/usr/share/man</TT>.

<P>
The cat page sections (<TT>cat&#60;section&#62;</TT>) containing formatted manual
page entries are also found within subdirectories of
<TT>&#60;mandir&#62;/&#60;locale&#62;</TT>, but are not required nor may they be
distributed in lieu of nroff source manual pages.

<P>
The numbered sections "1" through "8" are traditionally defined.  In
general, the file name for manual pages located within a particular
section end with <TT>.&#60;section&#62;</TT>.

<P>
In addition, some large sets of application-specific manual pages have
an additional suffix appended to the manual page filename.  For example,
the MH mail handling system manual pages must have <TT>mh</TT> appended
to all MH manuals.  All X Window System manual pages must have an
<TT>x</TT> appended to the filename.

<P>
The practice of placing various language manual pages in appropriate
subdirectories of <TT>/usr/share/man</TT> also applies to the other manual page
hierarchies, such as <TT>/usr/local/man</TT> and <TT>/usr/X11R6/man</TT>.
(This portion of the standard also applies later in the section on the
optional <TT>/var/cache/man</TT> structure.)

<TT>/var</TT> contains variable data files.  This includes spool
directories and files, administrative and logging data, and transient
and temporary files.

<P>
Some portions of <TT>/var</TT> are not shareable between different
systems.  For instance, <TT>/var/log</TT>, <TT>/var/lock</TT>, and
<TT>/var/run</TT>.  Other portions may be shared, notably
<TT>/var/mail</TT>, <TT>/var/cache/man</TT>, <TT>/var/cache/fonts</TT>,
and <TT>/var/spool/news</TT>.

<P>
<TT>/var</TT> is specified here in order to make it possible to mount
<TT>/usr</TT> read-only.  Everything that once went into <TT>/usr</TT>
that is written to during system operation (as opposed to installation
and software maintenance) must be in <TT>/var</TT>.

<P>
If <TT>/var</TT> cannot be made a separate partition, it is often
preferable to move <TT>/var</TT> out of the root partition and into the
<TT>/usr</TT> partition.  (This is sometimes done to reduce the size of
the root partition or when space runs low in the root partition.)
However, <TT>/var</TT> must not be linked to <TT>/usr</TT> because this
makes separation of <TT>/usr</TT> and <TT>/var</TT> more difficult and is
likely to create a naming conflict.  Instead, link <TT>/var</TT> to
<TT>/usr/var</TT>.

Applications must generally not add directories to the top level of
<TT>/var</TT>.  Such directories should only be added if they have some
system-wide implication, and in consultation with the FHS mailing list.

<TT>/var/cache</TT> is intended for cached data from applications.  Such
data is locally generated as a result of time-consuming I/O or

the application and rebooting the system.

This directory provides a standard location for sites that provide a
read-only <TT>/usr</TT> partition, but wish to allow caching of
locally-formatted man pages.  Sites that mount <TT>/usr</TT> as writable
(e.g., single-user installations) may choose not to use
<TT>/var/cache/man</TT> and may write formatted man pages into the
<TT>cat&#60;section&#62;</TT> directories in <TT>/usr/share/man</TT> directly.  We
recommend that most sites use one of the following options instead:

<UL>
<LI>Preformat all manual pages alongside the unformatted versions.

35.7.2 Background of the FHS</A>
</H2>

<P>
The process of developing a standard filesystem hierarchy began in
August 1993 with an effort to restructure the file and directory
structure of Linux.  The FSSTND, a filesystem hierarchy standard
specific to the Linux operating system, was released on February 14,
1994.  Subsequent revisions were released on October 9, 1994 and March
28, 1995.

<P>
In early 1995, the goal of developing a more comprehensive version of
FSSTND to address not only Linux, but other U<SMALL>NIX</SMALL>-like systems was
adopted with the help of members of the BSD development community.
As a result, a concerted effort was made to focus on issues that were
general to U<SMALL>NIX</SMALL>-like systems.  In recognition of this widening of
scope, the name of the standard was changed to Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard or FHS for short.

<P>
Volunteers who have contributed extensively to this standard are listed
at the end of this document.  This standard represents a consensus view
of those and other contributors.

35.7.3 General Guidelines</A>
</H2>

<P>
Here are some of the guidelines that have been used in the development
of this standard:

<UL>
<LI>Solve technical problems while limiting transitional difficulties.
</LI>
<LI>Make the specification reasonably stable.
</LI>
<LI>Gain the approval of distributors, developers, and other decision-makers
in relevant development groups and encourage their participation.
</LI>
<LI>Provide a standard that is attractive to the implementors of different
U<SMALL>NIX</SMALL>-like systems.

35.7.4 Scope</A>
</H2>

<P>
This document specifies a standard filesystem hierarchy for FHS
filesystems by specifying the location of files and directories, and the
contents of some system files.

<P>
This standard has been designed to be used by system integrators,
package developers, and system administrators in the construction and
maintenance of FHS compliant filesystems.  It is primarily intended to
be a reference and is not a tutorial on how to manage a conforming
filesystem hierarchy.

<P>
The FHS grew out of earlier work on FSSTND, a filesystem organization
standard for the Linux operating system.  It builds on FSSTND to address
interoperability issues not just in the Linux community but in a wider
arena including 4.4BSD-based operating systems.  It incorporates lessons
learned in the BSD world and elsewhere about multi-architecture support
and the demands of heterogeneous networking.

<P>
Although this standard is more comprehensive than previous attempts at
filesystem hierarchy standardization, periodic updates may become
necessary as requirements change in relation to emerging technology.  It
is also possible that better solutions to the problems addressed here
will be discovered so that our solutions will no longer be the best
possible solutions.  Supplementary drafts may be released in addition to
periodic updates to this document.  However, a specific goal is
backwards compatibility from one release of this document to the next.

<P>
Comments related to this standard are welcome.  Any comments or
suggestions for changes may be directed to the FHS editor (Daniel
Quinlan &#60;quinlan@pathname.com&#62;) or the FHS mailing
list.  Typographical or grammatical comments should be directed to the
FHS editor.

<P>
Before sending mail to the mailing list it is requested that you first
contact the FHS editor in order to avoid excessive re-discussion of old
topics.

<P>
Questions about how to interpret items in this document may occasionally
arise.  If you have need for a clarification, please contact the FHS
editor.  Since this standard represents a consensus of many
participants, it is important to make certain that any interpretation
also represents their collective opinion.  For this reason it may not be
possible to provide an immediate response unless the inquiry has been
the subject of previous discussion.

35.7.5 Acknowledgments</A>
</H2>

<P>
The developers of the FHS wish to thank the developers, system
administrators, and users whose input was essential to this standard.
We wish to thank each of the contributors who helped to write, compile,
and compose this standard.

<P>
The FHS Group also wishes to thank those Linux developers who
supported the FSSTND, the predecessor to this standard.  If they hadn't
demonstrated that the FSSTND was beneficial, the FHS could never have
evolved.
