<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>setfacl</B> utility sets discretionary access control information on the
     specified file(s).

     The following options are available:

     <B>-b</B>      Remove all ACL entries except for the three required entries.  If
	     the ACL contains a ``mask'' entry, the permissions of the
	     ``group'' entry in the resulting ACL will be set to the permis-
	     sion associated with both the ``group'' and ``mask'' entries of
	     the current ACL.

     <B>-d</B>      The operations apply to the default ACL entries instead of access
	     ACL entries.  Currently only directories may have default ACL's.

     <B>-h</B>      If the target of the operation is a symbolic link, perform the
	     operation on the symbolic link itself, rather than following the
	     link.

     <B>-k</B>      Delete any default ACL entries on the specified files.  It is not
	     considered an error if the specified files do not have any
	     default ACL entries.  An error will be reported if any of the
	     specified files cannot have a default entry (i.e. non-directo-
	     ries).

     <B>-m</B> <I>entries</I>
	     Modify the ACL entries on the specified files by adding new
	     entries and modifying existing ACL entries with the ACL entries
	     specified in <I>entries</I>.

     <B>-M</B> <I>file</I>
	     Modify the ACL entries on the specified files by adding new ACL
	     entries and modifying existing ACL entries with the ACL entries
	     specified in the file <I>file</I>.  If <I>file</I> is <B>-</B>, the input is taken
	     from stdin.

     <B>-n</B>      Do not recalculate the permissions associated with the ACL mask
	     entry.

     <B>-x</B> <I>entries</I>
	     Remove the ACL entries specified in <I>entries</I> from the access or
	     default ACL of the specified files.

     <B>-X</B> <I>file</I>
	     Remove the ACL entries specified in the file <I>file</I> from the access
	     or default ACL of the specified files.

     The above options are evaluated in the order specified on the command-
     line.


     <I>ACL</I> <I>qualifier</I>
	     The ACL qualifier field describes the user or group associated
	     with the ACL entry.  It may consist of one of the following: uid
	     or user name, gid or group name, or empty.  For ``user'' ACL
	     entries, an empty field specifies access granted to the file
	     owner.  For ``group'' ACL entries, an empty field specifies
	     access granted to the file owning group.  ``mask'' and ``other''
	     ACL entries do not use this field.

     <I>access</I> <I>permissions</I>
	     The access permissions field contains up to one of each of the
	     following: `r', `w', and `x' to set read, write, and execute per-
	     missions, respectively.  Each of these may be excluded or
	     replaced with a `-' character to indicate no access.

     A ``mask'' ACL entry is required on a file with any ACL entries other
     than the default ``user'', ``group'', and ``other'' ACL entries.  If the
     <B>-n</B> option is not specified and no ``mask'' ACL entry was specified, the
     <B>setfacl</B> utility will apply a ``mask'' ACL entry consisting of the union
     of the permissions associated with all ``group'' ACL entries in the
     resulting ACL.

     ACL entries applied from a file using the <B>-M</B> or <B>-X</B> options shall be of
     the following form: one ACL entry per line, as previously specified;
     whitespace is ignored; any text after a `#' is ignored (comments).

     When ACL entries are evaluated, the access check algorithm checks the ACL
     entries in the following order: file owner, ``user'' ACL entries, file
     owning group, ``group'' ACL entries, and ``other'' ACL entry.

     Multiple ACL entries specified on the command line are separated by com-
     mas.

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
     The <B>setfacl</B> utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
	   setfacl -m u::rwx,g:mail:rw file

     Sets read, write, and execute permissions for the <I>file</I> owner's ACL entry
     and read and write permissions for group mail on <I>file</I>.

	   setfacl -M file1 file2

     Sets/updates the ACL entries contained in <I>file1</I> on <I>file2</I>.

	   setfacl -x g:mail:rw file

     Remove the group mail ACL entry containing read/write permissions from
     <I>file.</I>
