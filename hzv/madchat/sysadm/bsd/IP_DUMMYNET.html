</H1>

<H2>1. Description</H2>

<TT>dummynet</TT> is a flexible tool originally designed for testing
networking protocols, and since then (mis)used for bandwidth
management.<P>

It simulates/enforces queue and bandwidth limitations, delays,
packet losses, and multipath effects. It also implements
a variant of Weighted Fair Queueing called WF2Q+. It can be used on user's
workstations, or on FreeBSD machines acting as routers or bridges.<P>

Just to get the idea of what you can do with dummynet, e.g. by
using dummynet on your workstation, or putting a PC with two ethernet
cards between your network and your router and booting from the <A
HREF="#PicoBSD">floppy-image</A> below, here are a few examples :<P>

These rules limit the total ICMP traffic (inbound+outbound)
to 50Kbit/s
<PRE>
    ipfw add pipe 1 icmp from any to any
    ipfw pipe 1 config bw 50Kbit/s queue 10
</PRE>
<P>

These rules limit inbound traffic to 300Kbit/s
for each host on your network 10.1.2.0/24.
<PRE>
    ipfw add pipe 2 ip from any to 10.1.2.0/24
    ipfw pipe 2 config bw 300Kbit/s queue 20 mask dst-ip 0x000000ff
</PRE>
If you want all machines to share evenly a single link, you should
use instead:
<PRE>
    ipfw add queue 1 ip from any to 10.1.2.0/24
    ipfw queue 1 config weight 5 pipe 2 mask dst-ip 0x000000ff
    ipfw pipe 2 config bw 300Kbit/s
</PRE>
<P>
And these rules simulate an ADSL link to the moon:
<PRE>
    ipfw add pipe 3 ip from any to any out
    ipfw add pipe 4 ip from any to any in
    ipfw pipe 3 config bw 128Kbit/s queue 10 delay 1000ms
    ipfw pipe 4 config bw 640Kbit/s queue 30 delay 1000ms
</PRE>

dummynet works by intercepting packets (selected by <TT>ipfw</TT>
rules - ipfw is one of the FreeBSD firewalls) in their way through
the protocol stack, and passing them through one or more objects
called <B>queue</B>s and <B>pipe</B>s, which simulate the effects of bandwidth
limitations, propagation delays, bounded-size queues, packet losses,
multipath. Pipes are fixed-bandwidth channels. Queues represent
instead queues of packets, associated with a weight, which share
the bandwidth of the pipe they are connected to proportionally
to their weight.
<P>

Each pipe and queue can be configured separately, so you can apply different
limitations/delays to different traffic according to the ipfw rules
(e.g. selecting on protocols, addresses and ports ranges, interfaces,
etc.).
Pipes and queues can be created dynamically, so using a single set of rules
you can apply independent limitations to all hosts in a subnet, or
to all types of traffic, etc.
You can also configure the system to build cascades of pipes, so
you can simulate networks with multiple links and paths between
source(s) and destination(s).<P>

<H2>2. Performance, status and availability</H2>

Unlike other traffic shaping packages which run in userland,
dummynet has a very little overhead, as
all processing is done within the kernel. There is
no data copying involved to move packets through pipes,
just a bit of pointer shuffling, and the implementation is
able to handle thousands of pipes with O(log N) cost, where N
is the number of active pipes.<P>

The WFQ variant we implement, called WF2Q+, has a complexity
which is O(log N) in the number of active flows, so again it
is able to handle efficiently thousands of flows.

dummynet is part of <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>
since Sept.1998. It has been recently (Jan.2000 and June 2000) rewritten, so the
most recent, feature-rich and robust versions are in FreeBSD
3.4-STABLE and newer releases.<P>

You don't need to install FreeBSD on your hard disk to use it, as
<A HREF="#PicoBSD">below</A> you will find a bootable single-floppy
version of FreeBSD which includes dummynet, bridging, and a lot of
other goodies.<P>

Dummynet is being heavily used by lots of people, and the code
seems to be extremely stable and robust, especially in the
3.4-STABLE version and above. Bug fixes are generally applied to the
FreeBSD source tree and are available from the
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/">CVS tree</A>
or in newer snapshot/releases of FreeBSD.
From time to time i update the floppy image on this site as well.<P>

<H2>3. Support</H2>

If you have found some bug, please <B>report it to me</B>
by email, but don't forget to include information on which
version of FreeBSD and dummynet you are using, your rules
<TT>(ipfw show; ipfw pipe show)</TT>, your configuration
(bridge or router) etc.<BR>
If you have a simple question, again just email me and i generally try
to reply as soon as possible. Again, please supply details!<BR>
For more complex things (like "i have
no time to learn how to use it, i just want this work done"), or
customizations and additions of new features to dummynet/ipfw, I
am available (through my department) for doing support on a contract
basis.<BR>
Email <A HREF="mailto:luigi@iet.unipi.it">luigi@iet.unipi.it</A>
for discussing details.<P>

This said, FreeBSD users should be able to use dummynet without
the need for support.<BR>
The relevant manpages (<TT>ipfw(8), dummynet(4), bridge(4)</TT>)
are a great source of information, so please read updated
version of them before asking questions.<BR>

You can also try posting
on the various FreeBSD mailing lists or newsgroups, they are
usually a very good source of information.<P>

<H2>4. Using dummynet</H2>

Dummynet is entirely controlled by the <TT>ipfw</TT> commands
and a set of sysctl variables.

<H2>4.1 Basic ipfw commands</H2>

The basic structure of ipfw commands is
<PRE>
   ipfw add [N] [prob X] action PROTO from SRC to DST [options]
</PRE>
where N is the rule number ;<BR>
X is a number between 0 and 1 that, when present, indicates
the probability of getting a match on this rule
if all other fields are correct. The default is deterministic
match;<BR>
<TT>action</TT> is one of the actions executed on a match,
which can be any of <TT>allow, deny, skipto N, pipe N</TT>
and others. To send a packet to a dummynet pipe, we have
to use <TT>pipe N</TT>;
PROTO is the protocol type we want to match (IP, TCP, UDP, ...);<BR>
SRC and DST are address specifier (we can use addresses with netmasks
and optionally followed by ports or port ranges);<BR>
<TT>options</TT> can be used to restrict the attention to
packets coming from/to specific interfaces, or carrying some
TCP flags or ICMP options, or bridged, etc.<P>

<H2>4.2 Sysctl variables</H2>

The following are the main sysctl variables to
 control the behaviour of ipfw, bridging and dummynet:

<H3>Controlling ipfw</H3>

The firewall is mostly controlled by <TT>ipfw</TT>, and the
sysctl variables only serve to give global configuration
and default parameters.

<PRE>
net.inet.ip.fw.enable: 1
	enables firewall in the IP stack

net.inet.ip.fw.one_pass: 1
	Forces a single pass through the firewall. If set to 0,
	packets coming out of a pipe will be reinjected into the
	firewall starting with the rule after the matching one.
	NOTE: there is always one pass for bridged packets.

net.inet.ip.fw.dyn_buckets: 256 (readonly)
	Current hash table size used for dynamic rules.

net.inet.ip.fw.curr_dyn_buckets: 256
	Desired hash table size used for dynamic rules.

net.inet.ip.fw.dyn_count: 3
	Current number of dynamic rules. (readonly)
	
net.inet.ip.fw.dyn_max: 1000
	Max number of dynamic rules. If you exceed this limit, you will
	have to wait for a rule to expire before being able to create
	a new one.

net.inet.ip.fw.dyn_ack_lifetime: 300
net.inet.ip.fw.dyn_syn_lifetime: 20
net.inet.ip.fw.dyn_fin_lifetime: 20
net.inet.ip.fw.dyn_rst_lifetime: 5
net.inet.ip.fw.dyn_short_lifetime: 5
	Lifetime (in seconds) for various types of dynamic rules.
</PRE>

<H3>Controlling dummynet</H3>

Also dummynet is mostly controlled by <TT>ipfw</TT>, with the
sysctl variables serving mostly for default parameters.

<PRE>
net.inet.ip.dummynet.hash_size: 64
	Size of hash table for dynamic pipes.

net.inet.ip.dummynet.expire: 1
	Delete dynamic pipes when they become empty.

net.inet.ip.dummynet.max_chain_len: 16
	Max ratio between number of dynamic queues and hash buckets.
	When you exceed (max_chain_len*buckets) queues on a pipe,
	packets not matching any of these will be all put into the
	same default queue.
</PRE>

<H3>Controlling bridging</H3>

Bridging is almost exclusively controlled by sysctl variables.

<PRE>
net.link.ether.bridge_cfg: ed2:1,rl0:1,
	set of interfaces for which bridging is enabled, and cluster
	they belong to.

net.link.ether.bridge: 0
	enable bridging.

net.link.ether.bridge_ipfw: 0
	enable ipfw for bridging.

</PRE>

<H2>4.3 Pipe and queue configuration</H2>

The following <TT>ipfw</TT> commands control dummynet pipes
<UL>
<LI><TT>ipfw pipe NN config ...</TT><BR>
This command is used to create or reconfigure a pipe.
NN is the numeric
identifier (between 1 and 65535) of the pipe. Issuing multiple
time the configuration command results in the pipe being
reconfigured.<P>

<LI><TT>ipfw [-s field] pipe [NN] show</TT><BR>
This command shows the parameters of a pipe. If the pipe is
a dynamic one (see <TT>mask</TT> parameter), then all dynamic
pipes created from this one are listed. The list can be very very
long. The -s option allows you to sort the listing on one
of the four counters associated to the pipe.

<LI><TT>ipfw pipe NN delete</TT>
Destroys a single pipe. Remember that packets sent to
a non-existing pipe are silently dropped.

<LI><TT>ipfw pipe flush</TT>
Destroys all pipes.
</UL>

The following parameters can be configured for a pipe, adding the
command in the <TT>pipe config... </TT> line:
<UL>
<LI><B>Bandwidth:</B> <TT>bw NNunit</TT><BR>
NN is the bandwidth assigned to the pipe, unit (which must
follow the number with no intervening spaces) can be any of
<TT>bit/s Kbit/s Mbit/s Byte/s KByte/s MByte/s</TT> or
non-ambiguous abbreviations.<BR>
A bandwidth of 0 (or no bandwidth) results in no bandwidth
limitations (hence, no queues will ever build up).

<LI><B>Queue size:</B> <TT>queue NN [unit]</TT><BR>
Sets the queue size, in slots if only NN is specified,
otherwise in Bytes or KBytes. When there is no room in the
queue, packets are dropped. The default queue size is 50 slots.<BR>
The combination of bandwidth
and queue size influence the queueing delay. Be careful
when using low bandwidths not to use too large queues, or
you might end up with several seconds of queueing delay.<BR>
Also be careful when you specify the queue size in packets:
if you run tests over the loopback interface, a packet can
be very large, e.g. 16KB, again resulting in huge delays.

<LI><B>Delay:</B> <TT>delay NN ms</TT><BR>
Sets the propagation delay of the pipe, in milliseconds.
Note that the queueing delay component is independent of
the propagation delay. Also note that all delays are approximated
with a granularity of 1/HZ seconds (HZ is typically 100, but we
suggest using HZ=1000 and maybe even larger values).

<LI><B>Random Packet Loss:</B> <TT>plr X</TT><BR>
X is a floating point number between 0 and 1 which causes
packets to be dropped at random. This is done generally to
simulate lossy links. The default is 0, or no loss.

<LI><B>Dynamic queue creation:</B> <TT>mask ...</TT><BR>
It is possible to associate a mask to a pipe so that
bandwidth and queue limitations are enforced separately
for packets  belonging to different flows.<P>
The <TT>mask</TT> command lets you specify which parts
of the following fields contribute to identify a flow:
<PRE>
[proto N] [src-ip N] [dst-ip N] [src-port N] [dst-port N]
</PRE>
where N is a bitmask where significant bits are set to 1.
You can specify one or more masks, or the <TT>all</TT>
keyword to mean that all fields are fully significant.<BR>
The default (when no mask are specified) is to ignore
all fields, so that all packets are considered to belong
to the same flow.<P>
Whenever a new flow is encountered, a new queue (with
the specified bandwidth and queue size) is created.<P>
<B>WARNING!!!</B> the number of dynamic queues that can
be created in this way can become very large. They are
accessed through a hash table, whose size you can define
using the <TT> buckets NN</TT> specifier after the mask command.
</UL>

To use WF2Q+, packets must be passed to queues which in turn
must be connected to a pipe.<P>

The following <TT>ipfw</TT> commands control dummynet pipes
<UL>
<LI><TT>ipfw queue NN config ...</TT><BR>
This command is used to create or reconfigure a queue.
NN is the numeric
identifier (between 1 and 65535) of the queue. Issuing multiple
time the configuration command results in the queue being
reconfigured.<P>

<LI><TT>ipfw queue NN delete</TT>
Destroys a single queue. Remember that packets sent to
a non-existing queue are silently dropped.

<LI><TT>ipfw queue flush</TT>
Destroys all queues.
</UL>

The following parameters can be configured for a queue, adding the
command in the <TT>queue config... </TT> line:
<UL>
<LI><B>Pipe:</B> <TT>pipe NN</TT><BR>
NN is the identifier of the pipe used for regulating traffic.

<LI><B>Weight:</B> <TT>weight NN</TT><BR>
NN is the weight (1..100, default 1)
associated to the queue.

<LI><B>Per-Flow queueing:</B> <TT>mask ...</TT><BR>
The syntax is the same as for pipes. However, all queues
created dynamically will share the parent pipe's bandwidth according
to the weight.

<LI><B>Queue size, Random Packet Loss:</B><BR>
Same as for pipes.
</UL>

<H2>5. Using dummynet for testing protocols</H2>

Dummynet was originally created to test network protocols and
applications, possibly even on a standalone system. As a consequence,
some of its features such as delay emulation, random loss etc. are
explicitly designed for that purpose.<P>
There are a few things you should take in mind when doing such
tests, to avoid getting incorrect results. They are all
obvious things, still it is better to have them in mind.<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Choosing a reasonable buffer size.</B><BR>
As said earlier, packet can be subject to a delay which is
proportional to the total queue size (in bytes), and inversely
proportional to the bandwidth. At low bandwidths, this queueing
delays can be extremely high, especially if the queue size is
defined in terms of packets and packets are large. The default
queue size is almost certainly too large for most purposes, and
it is often preferable to define the queue size in terms of 
bytes rather than packets.

<LI><B>Half-duplex vs. Full-duplex channels.</B><BR>
With the exception of shared-medium networks such as the
ethernet, most links that you want to simulate for your
experiments are full duplex. As such, the proper configuration
is the following:
<PRE>
    ipfw add pipe 1 ip from A to B
    ipfw add pipe 2 ip from B to A
    ipfw pipe 1 config ...
    ipfw pipe 2 config ...
</PRE>
Should you really need to mode a half duplex network,
then you can use the following sequence. But think twice before
you do so, as it is often a non-realistic mode.
<PRE>
    ipfw add pipe 3 ip from A to B
    ipfw add pipe 3 ip from B to A
    ipfw pipe 3 config ...
</PRE>
<P>
<LI><B>Interactions between bridging and multicast</B><BR>
You can use ipfw (and dummynet) in a bridge by setting some
sysctl variables:
<PRE>
	sysctl -w net.link.ether.bridge=1
	sysctl -w net.link.ether.bridge_ipfw=1
</PRE>
and then specify your firewall configuration.<BR>
Be careful when you run experiment involving multicast traffic
through a dummynet-enabled bridge.
Unless you set the rules right, multicast traffic in
a bridge goes through the firewall code twice: once
during forwarding at level 2, once when the packet is
passed to the local IP stack of the bridge.<P>
Starting from Feb.2000, there are to avoid this problem.
One involves a sysctl variable:
<PRE>
	sysctl -w net.inet.ip.fw.enable=0
</PRE>
which avoids that the firewall is invoked at the ip level.

Otherwise, you can use the <TT>bridged</TT> specifier in your
ruleset to match only bridged packets:
<PRE>
    ipfw add pipe 1 ip from any to any bridged
</PRE>
<P>

<LI><B>Running over the loopback interface.</B><BR>
Dummynet was originally designed for running experiments on a
standalone machine. The loopback interface lets you run
senders and receivers on the same machine, but you should
remember a few things:<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>The firewall is invoked on all packets.</B><BR>
This means that if you have a configuration such as
<PRE>
    ipfw add pipe 4 ip from 127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.1
    ipfw pipe 4 config delay 100ms
</PRE>
and do a simple <TT>ping 127.0.0.1</TT> you will see a delay
of approximately 400ms. In fact the ICMP request goes through
the pipe twice (once down, once up), and the same for the ICMP
reply. For the same reason, if you also have bandwidth or queue
limitations, remember that the queue sees the traffic multiple
times.<BR>
You can partially overcome this problem by using additional
ipfw options, e.g. specifying a direction
for matching packets, or the uid of the sender or receiving process.
Alternatively, you can assign multiple aliases to the loopback
interface, and make sure that the sender and receiver bind
their local endpoint to different addresses so that
you will have distinct rules matching traffic in the
two directions.<P>
<LI><B>The MTU of the loopback interface defaults to 16KB</B><BR>
The usual default for ethernet is 1500, and for point-to-point
links often smaller (576 or so). You can simply fix this by
redefining the mtu to the desired value with
<PRE>
    ifconfig lo0 mtu 1500
</PRE>
<P>
</UL>
<LI><B>TCP defaults.</B><BR>
Be very careful when using TCP, especially between processes running
on the same machine, or on the same subnet.<BR>
Apart from the MTU issue mentioned earlier, at least on FreeBSD,
TCP starts with a full window when the remote endpoint is on the
same subnet as one of the local addresses.
You need a simple fix in the source (tcp_input.c i believe)
to fix this behaviour in FreeBSD 3.x, whereas FreeBSD 4.x has
sysctl variable(s) to set the initial window.<BR>
Secondly, when you do experiments on configuration with
a large delay-bandwidth product, remember that many applications
use the default window size which is small, something like 16KB.
You might end up not using the full bandwidth just because your
data transfer is window-limited.
<P>
</UL>

<H2>5.1 Simulating multipath</H2>
One nice feature of the new version of dummynet is the ability to
simulate multiple paths between sender and receiver.
This is done using probabilistic match, e.g.:
<PRE>
    ipfw add prob 0.33 pipe 1 ip from A to B
    ipfw add prob 0.5  pipe 2 ip from A to B
    ipfw add           pipe 3 ip from A to B
    ipfw pipe 1 config ...
    ipfw pipe 2 config ...
    ipfw pipe 3 config ...
</PRE>
Given the right packet, the first rule will match with probability 1/3;
in the remaining 2/3 of occurrence we move to the second rule, which
will match with prob 1/2 (so overall 1/2*1/3 = 1/3), and the remaining
1/3 of occurrence will move to the third rule, which has a
deterministic match. We can then configure the three pipes as desired
to emulate phenomena such as packet reordering etc.
<P>

To conclude... if you want to try dummynet, here is a bootable
floppy image of a system with FreeBSD, bridging, ipfw, dummynet,
natd, ppp, drivers for a few interfaces, and accessible via telnet.<P>
To setup this system,
download the 1.44MB image,

Then put the floppy into a machine with hopefully at least one
interface, and wait for it to boot. When the system comes up,
login as root, password "setup", and you can play with 
bridging, ipfw and dummynet using the above commands.
