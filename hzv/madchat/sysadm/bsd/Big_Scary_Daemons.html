<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Par Michael Lucas<br>
12/21/2000</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the early days of Unix, installing a program
from source code was a hit-or-miss proposition at best. The now-pervasive
&quot;configure&quot; hadn't appeared yet. Every systems administrator had to
understand the platform a program had been written for, and its differences from
their platform, before they had a hope of porting a chunk of code. The
duplication of effort was truly monstrous. The FreeBSD ports system started
addressing this back in 1995; the system has scaled well, and is still very
popular among the BSD community.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In FreeBSD parlance, a &quot;port&quot; is
simply a set of instructions and patches for compiling a piece of software.
Ports have spread from FreeBSD to NetBSD and OpenBSD, where they've been changed
to fit those environments. (Since NetBSD uses &quot;ports&quot; to mean a
hardware platform, they call them &quot;packages.&quot;) The basic concepts
remain the same, however.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Most FreeBSD users understand the basics of
using a port: You go to the port's directory, type <code>make install</code>,
and the computer magically pulls the source code out of the ether, confirms it
hasn't been tampered with, uncompresses, patches, builds, and installs. The
overwhelming majority of the time, this system works perfectly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For most users, the most difficult problem is
finding the desired port. Right now FreeBSD has over four thousand ports,
scattered over forty-odd categories. I highly recommend pib (<code>/usr/ports/sysutils/pib</code>),
the Ports Index Browser. It's a simple <code>tk</code>-based tool that reads <code>/usr/ports/INDEX</code>
and presents a searchable, browsable interface.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you think <code>tk</code> is too heavy, or
just want to quickly find a single port, you can find most of them with <code>grep</code>.
When you know the port's name, you can use:</font></p>
<pre><code><font size="2" face="Courier New">grep -i ^portname /usr/ports/INDEX</font></code></pre>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The <code>^</code> tells grep that the word
appears at the beginning of the line, and considerably trims your search. A <code>grep
-i ^gtk INDEX</code> gives 29 results, where not using the <code>^</code> gives
387.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some ports don't work seamlessly. Either
FreeBSD has changed, or the original source code has changed, or the program has
features the port doesn't cover. When that happens, you can contact the port
maintainer or search the freebsd-questions archive to see if anyone else has had
the problem. Worst case, you need to break out your programming skills and try
to diagnose the problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In any case, it's a good idea to understand the
basics of the ports system. You need to solve the problem anyway, and if you can
send patches back to the FreeBSD project, you'll help a lot of people as well as
yourself.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you want to learn about the ports system,
you have four major sources of information.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, the FreeBSD handbook contains a
step-by-step tutorial on how to use the ports system. It covers just what's
needed to get started.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For more in-depth information than the handbook,
check ports (7). This describes the basic environment variables and make targets
that control port-building behavior.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The porter's handbook describes how to create a
port for FreeBSD.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, the big enchilada: <code>bsd.ports.mk</code>.
Any of the prior three might be out of date, depending on how overloaded the
documentation team is that week. The actual source code that controls the entire
process is <code>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.ports.mk</code>. If you find something in
bsd.ports.mk that doesn't match the documentation, the documents are incorrect.
(Patches can be sent via send-pr.) In a way, <code>bsd.ports.mk</code> is one of
the easiest pieces of FreeBSD code to read and understand; it's far simpler than,
say, the IP stack or the FTP client. Remember, there's a difference between
&quot;easy&quot; and &quot;easiest part of the system.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One term you'll find scattered throughout the
ports system is &quot;<code>distfile</code>.&quot; A <code>distfile</code> is
simply a file of source code. They're usually combined with <code>tar</code>,
and then compressed with gzip, zip, compress, or bzip.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A port itself is fairly simple. The ports tree
layout has recently changed, however, so we'll cover it briefly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Every port contains a <code>Makefile</code>.
This isn't your usual source code <code>Makefile</code>; instead, the port <code>Makefile</code>
tells FreeBSD how to build the source code it downloads. It includes such
information as which version of <code>make</code> to use, which compiler it
needs, and dependencies.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The file <code>distinfo</code> contains
distfile checksums. When the port was last updated, the port maintainer
confirmed the checksum of a known good <code>distfile</code> and recorded it
here.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The file <code>pkg-comment</code> contains a
one-line description of the port.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A longer description of the port, usually
including a URL for further information, is found in <code>pkg-descr</code>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The <code>pkg_plist</code> file has a list of
all files the port installs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The optional <code>files</code> directory
contains any patches needed to make the code compile on FreeBSD.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lastly, the optional <code>scripts</code>
directory contains scripts that can be run at various parts of the installation.
Scripts can be used for any pre- or post-processing that the port needs, for
example, to change permissions on a downloaded distfile so that patch(1) can run
properly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here's an overview of what happens when you go
to a port's directory and type <code>make install</code>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The process starts with <code>make fetch</code>.
If the source code isn't in <code>/usr/ports/distfiles</code>, your system goes
to the <code>MASTER_SITE</code> specified in the <code>Makefile</code> and gets
it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then, <code>make checksum</code> confirms that
the distfile's hashed signature matches the one that the port has on file. This
is meant as a security measure; if the source code contains a Trojan horse
loaded by an attacker, this process will detect it and stop the build with a
warning about a checksum mismatch.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, <code>make checksum</code> also
stops compilation if the <code>distfile</code> has been deliberately changed.
Software authors might make a minor change in their code, but give the source
file the same name when they make it available for download. The FreeBSD port
might or might not work after this change. If you're sure that the <code>distfile</code>
has not been compromised and want to try it anyway, you can override this with <code>make
NO_CHECKSUM=YES</code>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The <code>make depends</code> stage checks to
see if the port requires any other software to install. For example, an X window
manager requires an X server. Recursing through the various dependencies, <code>make
depends</code> builds them as needed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To create a <code>work</code> directory and
uncompress the distfile, use <code>make extract</code>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A port contains patches, if necessary, to allow
the software to build under FreeBSD; <code>make patch</code> applies them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Any configure script in the source code is run
by <code>make configure</code>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The <code>make build</code> stage compiles the
checked, extracted, and patched software.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, <code>make install</code> installs the
software and records its presence under <code>/var/db/pkg</code>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whenever you use a <code>make</code> target,
all previous stages are run. For example, a <code>make extract</code> runs
through <code>make fetch</code>, <code>make checksum</code>, and <code>make
extract</code>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now that you know what normally happens when
working with ports, next time we'll look at some ways to fine-tune a port.</font></p>
