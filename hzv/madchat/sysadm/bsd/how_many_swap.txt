Hi all.
                                                                                                                                               
I have a server with 1GB of RAM and a swap partition of 2GB i will upgrade
the memory server to 2GB so my questions are:
                                                                                                                                               
should i fix the swap partition to have now 4GB of space ?
                                                                                                                                               
what other changes do i have to make to my system after adding more ram ?

Dan's advice seems good; swapping more than a gig of data would be awful.
                                                                                                                                               
I'm replying because I want to answer your real question. <g> The notion
of swap = 2 x ram is an old one, and is no longer applicable.  (Some)
older VM systems used very simplistic swapping mechanisms, which required
entire processes to be swapped, thereby requiring large amounts of swap
space.  FreeBSD (and other modern OSes) page out to the swap file in
increments of 4K pages, and do so in a flexible manner.  As a result, you
should always have *some* swap space to handle overload cases, but it's
not necessary to keep any specific ram to swap ratio.
                                                                                                                                               
(Actually, the term "swapping" is still used inside the FreeBSD kernel,
but it only applies to paging out the last 20K or so of a process's
memory.)
                                                                                                                                               
Now, to contradict myself, there *is* a reason that you might wish to have
a larger swapfile.  Taking a crashdump requires that the swap file must be
of the size RAM + 64K or so.  Hence, your present swap file might be
slightly too small to take a crashdump once you upgrade to 2G ram.
Whether this is an issue for you or not depends on how often your machine
crashes and whether you wish to debug it. :)

Systems such as the Irix I used before moving the servers to FBSD
around 1996 - reserverd swap space for applications when the
application started up so those needed large swap space.  Often it
was never used, but the design allocated it anyway.

The real reason that 2 * sizeof(RAM) is often an overestimate on
FreeBSD is that FreeBSD overcommits swap (as others have pointed
out.)  Many (most?) other systems do not overcommit, including
Solaris.  Some systems, such as Tru64 (and Linux???) support both.
For these systems, 2 * sizeof(RAM) is sometimes even an underestimate.
                                                                                                                                               
These days overcommit is actually not very sensible.  Even though
it tends to overestimate space requirements, disk capacity has
outstripped RAM capacity to such an extent that the cost is
nominal.  The advantage of being more conservative is that you
never have to kill processes to save the kernel from deadlock.
(Wes recently added a simple feature that improved the situation,
but randomly killing processes is still a kludge.)
                                                                                                                                               
Unfortunately, getting non-overcommit right is hard.  In addition
to checking available space every time you allocate pageable
memory (including things like lazily copied map entries), you also
need to be careful to reserve enough space for stacks for each
application thread, etc.

Depends.  Have you ever used up that 2gb of swap?  If not, you'll
probably never consume 4gb either :)  If this is a database server, or
something similar where a few processes allocate large amounts of
memory, you don't need much swap anyway, since if any of those
processes actually has to swap, you end up thrashing the system as it
tries to swap 500mb processes in and out of memory.  I really can't
think of a system that would still perform well with 2 or 3GB of
process space in swap.  At the 2gb RAM point, you usually have a system
where any swapping == bad news.
