<p> Earlier in this series, I wrote about creating password policies and
using password cracking utilities. (See <a
href="/pub/a/bsd/2001/01/17/FreeBSD_Basics.html"> Establishing Good
Password Policies</a> and <a
href="/pub/a/bsd/2001/01/24/FreeBSD_Basics.html"> Cracking Passwords to
Enhance Security</a>.) You may recall that it can be challenging to create
a password policy that balances ease of use with effectiveness. Also,
utilities exist which are capable of cracking even the most hard to guess
passwords. In today's article, I'd like to demonstrate an alternative
authentication system which is available on your FreeBSD system.  </p>

<p>By default, when you login to your FreeBSD system, you are prompted for
a password. This is known as a "reusable password" because you can input
the same password whenever you login, until you either change the password
on your own or are forced to change an expired password. This provides a
measure of security: someone who doesn't know your password won't be able
to access the resources on your system. However, this security is
jeopardized if another user discovers your password.  </p>

<p> There is another authentication system known as One Time Passwords
(OTP).  As the name suggests, you can only use a password once; you aren't
allowed to reuse it. An OTP system ensures that a discovered password is
useless to the person who discovers it. This can provide a bit more
security in a world that contains password crackers, packet sniffers, and
<a href="http://www.microspy.com/">keyloggers</a>.  </p>

<h3>Introducing OTP</h3>

<p>OTP was developed at Bellcore (now Telcordia). Originally, it was a
freely available software program known as S/Key. If you're interested,
you can read <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/haller94skey.html">the
original paper on S/Key</a>.  </p>

<p>Bellcore went on to trademark the term S/Key in order to develop a
commercial product. Software development continued elsewhere under the
name One-time Passwords In Everything (OPIE). OTP eventually evolved into
hardware products as well. For an overview of the development of both
software and hardware OTP, see <a
href="http://www.deer-run.com/~hal/ns2000/otp.pdf">this overview</a>
(PDF).  </p>

<p> I won't show you how to integrate hardware OTP with your FreeBSD
system as I'll assume that, like me, you don't have the budget to go out
and purchase hardware tokens and proprietary authentication servers.</p>

<p>Fortunately, software OTP comes with your FreeBSD system and is easily
configured. If you're using FreeBSD 4.x or lower, you already have both
<code>s/key</code> and <code>opie</code> installed.  <code>opie</code> is
considered to be more secure as it uses MD5, whereas <code>s/key</code>
uses the less secure MD4.  (See <a
href="/pub/a/bsd/2002/10/31/FreeBSD_Basics.html">Cryptographic Terminology
101</a>.)  Starting with FreeBSD 5.0, <code>s/key</code> will be phased
out and only <code>opie</code> will be supported.  I will cover the
configuration of <code>opie</code> in this article.  </p>

<h3>Starting OTP</h3>

<p> Before you can begin to use <code>opie</code>, you must add yourself
to the <code>opie</code> database in <code>/etc/opiekeys</code>. By
default this database is empty, which means you should just get your
prompt back if you run this command: </p>

<pre><code>$ more /etc/opiekeys</code></pre>

<p> To add yourself to the database, use the <code>opiepasswd</code>
command with the console switch: </p>

<pre><code>$ opiepasswd -c
Adding dlavigne6:
Only use this method from the console; NEVER from remote. If you are using
telnet, xterm, or a dial-in, type ^C now or exit with no password.
Then run opiepasswd without the -c parameter.
Using MD5 to compute responses.
Enter new secret pass phrase: 
Secret pass phrases must be between 10 and 127 characters long.
Enter new secret pass phrase: 
Again new secret pass phrase: 

ID dlavigne6 OTP key is 499 dh0391
CHUG ROSA HIRE MALT DEBT EBEN</code></pre>

<p>Let's take a closer look at what happened when I ran this
command. Notice the warning at the beginning. When you run
<code>opiepasswd -c</code> you want to be either physically sitting at the
machine you normally login to or connected to the machine via
<code>ssh</code>. Otherwise, your secret pass phrase and resulting
one-time password will be sent over the network in clear text, defeating
the purpose of the exercise.</p>

<p> I was then prompted for a secret pass phrase, and I received a warning
because my original pass phrase was too short. This pass phrase is similar
in concept to the pass phrase we saw when we generated a public/private
key pair in <a href="/pub/a/bsd/2002/11/14/FreeBSD_Basics.html">The SSH
Cryptosystem</a>. This pass phrase isn't used as a password per se;
instead, it is used to prove that I am the person who added the
<code>dlavigne6</code> account to the database and the rightful owner of
the resulting "response" or one-time password. That response is comprised
of those six uppercase nonsense words.  </p>

<p> At this point, I can verify that I am indeed in the <code>opie</code>
database: </p>

<pre><code>$ more /etc/opiekeys
dlavigne6 0499 dh0391           669a4a62db6714f3  Jan 18,2003 15:25:44</code></pre>

<p> Notice that there is one entry in the database which contains my username,
followed by a counter (499), followed by a seed (dh0391), followed by a key
(669a4a62db6714f3), followed by the date and time the entry was added to the
database. The counter and the seed are very important as they are used whenever
I need to generate a one-time password.  </p>

<p> If I ever need to verify my counter and seed, I should use this
command:
</p>

<pre><code>$ opieinfo
498 dh0391</code></pre>

<p> The <code>opieinfo</code> command displays the count that will be used
the next time I login. Note that it is expecting the response associated
with "498", but I only know the response for "499". To figure out what
response is expected, I use an OTP calculator, which is really the
<code>opiekey</code> command.  </p>

</p>

<h3>Logging In</h3>

<p>At this point I also have a choice: I can either use the calculator
from a separate terminal every time I login, or I can print myself a list
of responses and regenerate a new list whenever I run out of
responses. Let's try both methods, starting with the first: </p>

<pre><code>login: dlavigne6
otp-md5 498 dh0391 ext
Password:</code></pre>

<p>Notice that when I login, I receive an OTP challenge.
<code>opie</code> is waiting for the response, or one-time password,
associated with counter 498. By default, users can decide whether or not
to use OTP when they login. If I decide instead to type in my reusable
password, it will be accepted and I'll login as usual.  </p>

<p>If I decide to login using OTP, I'll first need to calculate the
correct response. It doesn't matter where I use the calculator, <strong>as
long as i don't use it over a non-encrypted network connection</strong>. I
could use the calculator from another virtual terminal; for example, I
could press Alt-F3, login locally and run the calculator. Alternately, if
I have access to another computer in the room, or even a Palm Pilot
running the calculator software, I could calculate the response there.
</p>

<p> In order to use the calculator I need to know three things: </p>

<ul>
<li>the current counter</li>
<li>my seed</li>
<li>my secret pass phrase</li>
</ul>

<p>The current counter and seed are displayed in the challenge. However,
it is important that only I know my secret pass phrase; otherwise, anyone
could calculate the response and login as if they were me.  </p>

<p>When I use the calculator, I include the count I need the response for
as well as my seed: </p>

<pre><code>$ opiekey 498 dh0391
Using the MD5 algorithm to compute response.
Reminder: Don't use opiekey from telnet or dial-in sessions.
Enter secret pass phrase:
MASK BALM COL HER RIFT TERM</code></pre>

<p>Note that I was prompted for my secret pass phrase, then given the
response associated with counter 498: <code>MASK BALM COL HER RIFT
TERM</code>.  </p>

<p>Now that I know the correct response, I can return to my login prompt:
</p>

<pre><code>login: dlavigne6
otp-md5 498 dh0391 ext
Password: (here I pressed enter)
otp-md5 498 dh0391 ext
Password [echo on]: mask balm col her rift term</code></pre>

<p>This time, instead of typing my reusable password, I pressed Enter
which turned on echo. This allowed me to see the response as I typed
it. Echo is a bad thing with reusable passwords which is why it is always
off. However, with a one-time password, it doesn't matter if anyone sees
me typing it as it can't be reused. Also, unlike a reusable password, the
response is not case sensitive so it doesn't matter if I type it in upper
or lower case.  </p>

<p>Now if I do an <code>opieinfo</code>, I'll see that the next expected
response will be for counter 497. That is, every time I use a one-time
password, the counter is decreased by one. I can merrily continue to
calculate and use up my responses; I need only be careful that I never let
my counter decrease to 0.  </p>

<h3>Generating Multiple Keys</h3>

<p> It may not always be convenient to use the calculator every time you
want to login. Let's demonstrate the second method, where a list of
responses is generated.  </p>

<p>This time, I'll use the number or <code>n</code> switch with the
calculator, to indicate how many responses I'd like to calculate. Here,
I'll generate a list of 10 responses, starting at the next expected count
of 497:</p>

<pre><code>$ opiekey -n 10 497 dh0391

Using the MD5 algorithm to compute response.
Reminder: Don't use opiekey from telnet or dial-in sessions.
Enter secret pass phrase: 
488: COIN LO DOG GOLF ACTA FULL
489: SOD STUN SINK DRAW LAWN TILT
490: MALT STAY MASH CAR DEBT WAST
491: HOWE DRY WALL TOO BUDD SWIM
492: ROOT SPY BOND JEST HAIL SCAR
493: MEAN ADD NEON CAIN LION LAUD
494: LYLE HOLD HIGH HOME ITEM MEL
495: WICK BALI MAY EGO INK TOOK
496: RENT ARM WARN ARC LICE DOME
497: LEAD JAG MUCH MADE NONE WRIT</code></pre>

<p> I now know what my next ten passwords will be. At this point, I could
copy them to a piece of paper and store them in a safe place such as my
wallet.  Alternately, when you generate your own list, you could send the
output to a file like so: </p>

<pre><code>$ opiekey -n 10 497 dh0391 > secretlist</code></pre>

<p> and print the list. Be careful to remove that file from your hard drive once
you've printed it as you don't want to keep a copy of your next ten passwords
on your hard drive.  </p>

<p> If my counter gets dangerously low, say around 10, I should reset it using
the <code>opiepasswd</code> command. Once you're in the password database, use
the <code>n</code> or number switch in combination with the <code>s</code> or
seed switch instead of the <code>c</code> switch. In the next example, I'll
reset the counter back to 499 and change my seed to dh1357. When I do so, I'll
be prompted for the response associated with my current counter, which happens
to be 8: </p>

<pre><code>$ opiepasswd -n 499 -s dh1357
Updating dlavigne6:
You need the response from an OTP generator.
Old secret pass phrase:
	otp-md5 8 dh0391 ext
	Response: loot omit safe eric jolt dark
New secret pass phrase:
	otp-md5 499 dh1357
	Response: hewn as dot mel mali mann</code></pre>

<h3>Finishing Up</h3>

<p> At this point, you may be wondering when would be the best time to
actually use OTP, since you have a choice of using either OTP or a
reusable password whenever you receive a login prompt. You probably won't
use OTP when you login to a remote computer as you should use SSH for that
purpose. Since SSH ensures that all of your information is encrypted, it
has no need for OTP and hence does not support OTP. However, OTP can be
appropriate when you need to login to your computer and you are concerned
about "shoulder surfing" or someone else noticing your password as you
type it in. For example, you may be in a crowded area with your
laptop. Your computer may happen to be located in a high traffic area,
which increases the possibility of someone noticing what password you use
to login.  </p>

<p>It is convenient to leave users with the choice of using or not using
OTP depending upon the likelihood of someone else noticing their password
when they need to login. It is also possible to change this default and
configure your FreeBSD system to force users to always use OTP. The
original way to do this was to create a file called
<code>/etc/opieaccess</code>. However, this method is considered to be a
security hole and is even cautioned against in <code>man
opieaccess</code>.  </p>

<p> The preferred method is to use Pluggable Authentication Modules
(PAM). Since I want to spend a fair bit of time on PAM, I will end this
week's article here. In the next article, I'll introduce PAM, then carry
on by configuring OTP as an example.  </p>
