Quick Unofficial AddOn:
Get Sqwebmail to run as  vpopmail.vchkpw  and not as root.root

With default install, if this fits your case...
> Chown the directory which contains the socket to authdaemon.
> (Remember to check that the suid bit is still set after)
chown vpopmail.vchkpw /usr/(local)/share/sqwebmail/var/authdaemon
chown vpopmail.vchkpw .../cgi-bin/sqwebmail
chmod +s .../cgi-bin/sqwebmail

(/usr en 755 (drwxr-xr-x root root) else if 711 authdaemon fails)

or rather don't use authdaemon at all ! it's not needed, changepass is enabled by default.

1. About this Document
----------------------

I wrote this document because of the severe lack of *GOOD* documentation for a full Qmail 
setup. I tried to make this document as generic as possible and as broad so that it will cater to 
all needs but I am bound to miss out many key factors. If there is anything else you would 
like to know that I haven't mentioned in this document please feel free to e-mail me at 
simbajaj@slackwarelinux.net so that I can update the document as necessary.

This document is free to the public and to anyone in fact but please let me know if you make 
any modifications so I may update my copy as well =). Please feel free to add-on 
redistribute or do what ever you want with but PLEASE don't claim it as yours, I have a 
personal grudge against hypocrites. I don't know much, or rather I'm too lazy to check, on how 
I'd get this on the GPL but I do hope you guys realise this document is somewhere along those 
lines. 

If you want to know more about me, which is highly unlikely, please proceed to 
http://www.slackwarelinux.net

This document is split into 2 parts. One is the quick and dirty section for those who just 
want to get the show on the road, the second part is a full explaination of other options 
available. If you need your Qmail up and running within half and hour and you think you can 
handle the really vague instructions feel free to go with the quick and dirty. If you do 
have a lot of time please just relax and read through the document. Most things are generic 
to most Unix OS's but I haven't had the opportunity to test this on all Unix OS's but I will 
try and keep this document as generic and as current as possible. All the commands are 
usually Linux-based so if you encounter any problems I humbly apologise for any 
inconvenience caused. Now on with it!

2. Why use Qmail ?
------------------

The question you should be asking yourself is why not ? Qmail is one of the most powerful 
MTA's available on the market as well as the most secure unlike sendmail which I daresay is 
bug ridden.

Qmail is the best solution for any ISP and the only bad thing that I found in Qmail is lack 
of documentation, hence this HOWTO. Whether you are an ISP or just someone that wants to use 
his box as a mail server Qmail is by far an excellent choice. 

3. What You Need

5. Quick and Dirty Installation
-------------------------------

Please make sure you've downloaded all the above source packages. I don't deal with binaries 
in this section. Compiling is a good habit to have after all ;).

I've tried to make everything as modular as possible so you could possibly try one instruction 
at a time if you already have an existing copy of qmail installed. Anything that is contained 
within "< >" will have to be added in manually by yourself. Good luck!

And this will start up all the servers. Add the above 3 commands to all the startup scripts 
and you should be well on your way.

6. Full Tutorial
----------------

tcprules 0.88
+++++++++++++

The first step to installing Qmail is by installing ucspi-tcp package or more often called the 
tcprules program. tcprules is sort of a replacement for inetd, the traditional Unix super 
server. 

tcprules is used almost the same way as inetd as in it listens to a port and whenever a 
conneciton is made, it activates the necessary daemon which in this case is either POP3d or 
SMTP. Vpopmail requires tcprules so that is why we're going to install that first =). 

tcprules does not use the /etc/hosts.allow or /etc/hosts.deny files but instead it's own 
format of cdb files. This I will explain at a later part when we have to create one for use 
with the SMTP server.

There's not much controversy or arguements when setting up the tcprules program, there's only 
one way to do it so no one will argue with you about this one.

a. tar zxvf ucspi-tcp-0.88.tar.gz
b. cd ucspi-tcp-0.88
c. make
d. make setup check

Now that you have tcprules installed we can continue with installing of the actual mail 
software. Bear in mind that tcprules is installed in /usr/local/bin, so if anyone asks it's 
there unless of course you made some changes to it.

The next step is to install Qmail itself. Qmail comes with a whole suite of applications like 
a POP3 server and an SMTP server. I will tell you where these are once the install is 
complete.

Qmail 1.03
++++++++++

a. tar zxvf qmail-1.03.tar.gz
b. cd qmail-1.03
c. mkdir /var/qmail

The main security features in Qmail lie in the below. Qmail, unlike sendmail, runs as a normal 
user and not as a super user or anything so it becomes really tough for any hacker (or cracker 
as it may seem) to hack it because normal users really can't do that much.

Bear in mind that when you create the below users assign a bogus shell to them because we 
don't want anyone logging in using those accounts. The commands below are pretty general and 
are Linux-based. If you want to know how to add them other OS's please use the INSTALL.ids 
file in the Qmail source directory.

d. groupadd nofiles
e. useradd -g nofiles -d /var/qmail/alias alias
f. useradd -g nofiles -d /var/qmail qmaild
g. useradd -g nofiles -d /var/qmail qmaill
h. useradd -g nofiles -d /var/qmail qmailp
i. groupadd qmail
j. useradd -g qmail -d /var/qmail qmailq
k. useradd -g qmail -d /var/qmail qmailr
l. useradd -g qmail -d /var/qmail qmails

This is the actual installation of Qmail. It will install all the files to /var/qmail, the 
directory that was created in the first step. There is a directory called /var/qmail/bin, in 
this directory there are several binaries such as qmail-smtp and qmail-popup. These are what 
we will be using later to setup our initialisation scripts.

m. make setup check

If your DNS is configured correctly you can just use ./config and it will setup your hostname 
automatically without worry. But if on the other other hand you haven't setup the DNS right 
and you just want to get on with the installation just type the below command with your full 
hostname. For example, if I'm hosting the domain test.com and I haven't set up my DNS right I 
would just type ./config-fast test.com and it will add in the necessary.

n. ./config-fast <your.full.host.name>

The below commands are pretty interesting, well I find them interesting anyway. Whenever you 
create a .qmail-* it will forward all mails that come in for that account to the main 
Postmaster account on Qmail. It is basically a mail forwarder. Since Qmail (in this instance) 
does not work with the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files the usernames in those files do not 
really matter so all mail that comes in for any usernames in those files will automatically be 
bounced normally. But in this case if a mail comes in for root@yourdomain.com it will 
automatically be sent to the Postmaster account because the .qmail-root forward has been 
created.

This will eliminate all the bounce messages that usually would occur if such an account didn't 
actually exist.

o. touch ~alias/.qmail-postmaster ~alias/.qmail-mailer-daemon ~alias/.qmail-root
p. chmod 644 ~alias/.qmail*

Since there is a very high percentage of sendmail users on this planet still, Qmail has a 
binary that works under the same pretext as sendmail. This binary is located in 
/var/qmail/bin/sendmail.

A lot of CGI scripts would find this binary very useful, scripts such as Matt's FormMail. So 
it would be best if you copied the sendmail binary into all the necessary directories as 
stated below.

q. cp /var/qmail/bin/sendmail /usr/bin /usr/lib /usr/sbin

This command copies the Qmail initialisation file to /var/qmail for easy access and makes it 
much easier to start Qmail. Command (s) is something more intricate. By making the change in 
the /var/qmail/rc file, Qmail will use the Maildir format instead of the traditional Mailbox 
format.

Sounds confusing ? Well not really. Most mail daemons such as sendmail use Mailbox format. 
Mailbox is a rather stupid idea when it comes to reliability. What Mailbox format does is that 
when a messages comes in it is stored in a SINGLE file along with all other messages.

For instance if anonymous@test.com receives a message it is stored in a file called Mailbox 
and soon enough he receives another message that is also stored in the same file. Assuming the 
file gets corrupted all is lost and that is a severe pain in the ass.

To go around this problem Qmail has introduced something called the Maildir format. Using the 
Maildir format, every new message is stored in it's own file so if there is a corruption in 
that file the only thing lost is that one message and not all the messages, in view of this I 
would suggest that everyone use the Maildir format as it is much more reliable. Qmail does 
support the Mailbox format but I don't think you'd like it very much.

r. cp /var/qmail/boot/home /var/qmail/rc
s. Edit /var/qmail/rc and change the word Mailbox to Maildir.

With the below commands we will setup an initialization script using Qmail's native SMTP 
server. As you can see from the file below it has a mention of tcp.smtp.cdb, this is the file 
that is used for all relaying information. It basically stores a list of IP addresses that are 
allowed to relay mail from your server. I will delve deeper into this later on when the file 
is to be created.

t. touch /var/qmail/smtpd
u. Edit /var/qmail/smtpd and add in the following script :-

#!/bin/sh

/usr/local/bin/tcpserver -x /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb -v -u <uid of qmaild> -g <uid of nofiles> 0 
smtp /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd 2>&1 | /var/qmail/bin/splogger smtpd 3 &

Make sure all the above is in one line.

These commands simply make the scripts that we have ready executable for future use.

v. chmod +x /var/qmail/rc 
w. chmod +x /var/qmail/smtpd


autorespond-1.0.0
+++++++++++++++++

Autorespond, as it's name suggests, adds autoresponding functionality to Qmail. It's really 
easy to install but there are no Makefiles so just follow the commands below as it's pretty 
staightforward

a. tar zxvf autorespond-1.0.0
b. cd autorespond-1.0.0

If you receive any warnings or errors don't be alarmed, it's perfectly fine. Just follow the 
instructions.

c. gcc -Wall -o autorespond autorespond.c
d. cp autorespond /usr/local/bin

ezmlm 0.53
++++++++++

There are 2 packages to EZMLM. EZMLM basically stands for EZ Mailing List Manager. You don't 
really HAVE to have this package but it's nice to have mailing list support =). The second 
package ezmlm-idx is actually an add-on for ezmlm and provides manu advanced features. You can 
check out the website if you want to know, I won't go into it right now. Just head on down to 
http://www.ezmlm.org/.

If you only want a basic version of EzMLM just skip steps (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f).

a. tar zxvf ezmlm-0.53.tar.gz
b. tar zxvf ezmlm-idx-0.40.tar.gz
c. cd ezmlm-idx-0.40
d. cp * ../ezmlm-0.53
e. cd ../ezmlm-0.53

This command basically patches EzMLM to support the enhanced idx functionality.

f. patch < idx.patch
g. make
h. make man
i. make setup

vpopmail 4.9.10
+++++++++++++++

Vpopmail is another one Inter7's create creations. Vpopmail allows Qmail to handle several 
virtual domains and this is excellent for web hosting companies or anything else along those 
lines. 
 
I'd recommend vpopmail for several reasons including it's Maidlir support as well as support 
for web-based mail readers like SQWebmail (below) and QmailAdmin for Mail administration (also 
below.

a. tar zxvf vpopmail-4.9.10.tar.gz
b. cd vpopmail-4.9.10

The same rule applies where the below groupadd and useradd commands change for different OS's.

c. groupadd vchkpw

All virtual domains as well as mails will be stored in the vpopmail user's home directory so I 
suggest you find a nice place for this with enough disk space. /home will be fine but I 
usually put it in /var

d. useradd -g vchkpw -d <path to vpopmail> vpopmail

The below step is very important as it will allow relaying via your SMTP server. Just create a 
file called /etc/tcp.smtp and all in all the IPs that are required in the format shown below. 
This is a plain text file but the tcprules program in step (f) will allow it to be changed to 
cdb format and therework work! =)

e. Edit /etc/tcp.smtp to reflect the following

127.0.0.:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""

Add in any other IP ranges you see fit as this will allow you to put in IPs that are allowed 
to relay.
f. tcprules /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb /etc/tcp.smtp.tmp < /etc/tcp.smtp

There are several configuration options for vpopmail. For the --enable-logging tag it is set 
to "e" which means it would just log errors and nothing else. "y" would make it simply log 
everything which would be a real pain on your log files, "n" would turn off logging 
completely and "p" would log everything including wrong passwords entered.

If you are intending to install sqwebmail along with vpopmail I would suggest you use the tag 
--enable-sqwebmail-pass=y , this will allow Sqwebmail users to change their password via their 
e-mail interface. It is disabled by default so if you don't want it just follow the below.

If you have created your vpopmail user with any other username be sure to add it into the 
below with --enable-vpopuser=username and the same goes for the group with 
--enable-vpopgroup=groupname.

The tag --enable-roaming-users will allow authentication-after-pop. Essentially what this does 
is that if a user authenticates via the POP server he will be allowed to relay through the 
server's SMTP without the need for his IP address in the /etc/tcp.smtp. I haven't got this to 
work before for some reason but I think it's pretty neat. I'll update this document as soon as 
I've had more time to play with it. 

g. ./configure --enable-tcprules-prog=/usr/local/bin/tcprules --enable-logging=e --enable-tcpserver-file=<path to tcp.smtp>
h. make
i. make install-strip

The below is another startup script for the POP3 server. If you don't need a POP3 then there's 
really no problem with this. If you do just follow the instructions and everything will be 
fine.

j. Edit /var/qmail/pop3d to reflect the following :

#!/bin/sh

/usr/local/bin/tcpserver 0 pop3 /var/qmail/bin/qmail-popup <your.full.host.name> 
/var/vpopmail/bin/vchkpw /var/qmail/bin/qmail-pop3d Maildir &

Make sure this is all in one line.
k. chmod +x /var/qmail/pop3d

SQWebmail 2.11
++++++++++++++

a. tar zxvf sqwebmail-2.11.tar.gz
b. cd sqwebmail-2.11

Make sure you have Apache or whichever web server setup for Sqwebmail. There's not much to be 
done really, just make sure you know where you want the files to be and fill in the blanks.

As for the --with-module option, it is essential that you put down authvchkpw so that 
SQwebmail is aware that Vpopmail is being used as the virtual domain manager. 

There are some other interesting options. If you have fastcgi installed in Apache you can 
maximise it by adding the --with-fcgi option.

If you are really security conscious and don't want passwords being transmitted without 
encryption you can use SSL with SQWebmail. To do this simple add the --with-https option. If 
you want only the passwords and logins sent using encryption and the rest of the session to be 
without encryption just put in --with-https=login.

If you want a spell check in SQWebmail simply install ispell or if it's already installed just 
add in the --with-ispell=<path to ispell>

c. ./configure --with-htmllibdir=<path to where you want the HTML files 
to be> --enable-cgibindir=<path to where you want the CGI to be> --enable-mimetypes=<path to 
Apache/conf/mimetypes> --with-module=authvchkpw --enable-imagedir=<path to where the images 
for sqwebmail are to be stored> --enable-webpass=vpopmail

d. make configure-check
e. make
f. make check
g. make install-strip

Please note that to log onto SQWebmail or to setup any POP3 accounts your username will be 
your FULL e-mail address. 

QmailAdmin 0.45
+++++++++++++++

QmailAdmin is a neat software. It allows domain owners to administer domains via a web 
interface. It's not really made for system administrators as it doesn't allow you to add new 
domains and stuff like that so this will be pretty much useless for root users unless you are 
really lazy =).

QmailAdmin has built-in support for many things like EzMLM and AutoRespond. One of the 
drawbacks is the quota support which I am so eagerly waiting for, I will they'd get it up and 
running soon!

a. tar zxvf qmailadmin-0.45.tar.gz
b. cd qmailadmin-0.45

There is this weird bug in Vpopmail which does not include to files in the vpopmail/etc 
directory. These files are essential to QmailAdmin's installation. Check to see if the files 
lib_deps and inc_deps exist in vpopmail/etc and if it doesn't please follow th below steps.

If the file exists just skip on to step (e).

c. If the files <path to vpopmail>/etc/inc_deps and <path to vpopmail>/etc/lib_deps don't 
exist please run this command, if they do exist then just skip until step (e).

echo "-I</path/to/vpopmail>/include" > <path to vpopmail>/etc/inc_deps
d. echo "-L<path to vpopmail>/lib -lvpopmail" > <path to vpopmail>/etc/lib_deps

The below is pretty much standard and if you have installed all the programs in different 
directories please type ./configure --help | more for further options. 

e. ./configure --enable-cgibindir=<path to CGI-Bin directory> --enable-htmllibdir=<path to 
HTML location>

Note that for the htmllibdir, it should not be web accessible.

f. make
g. make install-strip

Courier-IMAP 1.3.8.1
++++++++++++++++++++

a. tar zxvf courier-imap-1.3.8.1.tar.gz
b. cd courier-imap-1.3.8.1
c. ./configure --with-module=authvchkpw
d. make
e. make install

Finishing Up
++++++++++++

a. /var/qmail/rc &
b. /var/qmail/smtpd &
c. /var/qmail/pop3d &
d. /usr/lib/courier-imap/libexec/imapd.rc start

And this will start up all the servers. Add the above 3 commands to all the startup scripts 
and you should be well on your way.

7. Administration Information
-----------------------------

Qmail Information
+++++++++++++++++

There's really not much administration to be done. This is just to tell you stuf like how to 
add users or domains and all that nonsense.

Somethings you might want to know is that all messages are kept in a queue before they are 
sent out their respective users. This queue is located at /var/qmail/queue. Not that hard was 
it ?

Vpopmail Information
++++++++++++++++++++

There are several things to note with vpopmail. Vpopmail is a VIRTUAL pop manager which means 
it can support several domains without using several IPs or any /etc/passwd files. 

There are a few things that you will probably use when you use vpopmail. Firstly you'd 
probably add domains if you have more than one. To do this go to /var/vpopmail/bin or wherever 
your vpopmail/bin directory is and type vadddomain domain.com . It's really simple. This will 
create a domain directory in /var/vpopmail/domains/domain.com. This domain will be dedicated 
to that domain and there is always a default domain "super user" which is Postmaster. 
Postmaster has the ability to remove and create accounts and forwards and other such things.

Secondly, you would probably want to create more users =) If you haven't installed QmailAdmin 
you can do this manually by going to Vpopmail's bin directory and typing ./vadduser 
username@domain.com. This will create the user's Maildir in 
vpopmail/domains/domain.com/username/

This is a very important point you have to note when using Vpopmail is that when you configure 
your POP3 client or try to log on to SQWebmail or any other web interface your username is 
your FULL e-mail address. So if your e-mail is username@domain.com your username is also 
username@domain.com and not just username.

Thats about all really =) Good luck with everything. If you have any other problems please 
feel free to contact me at simbajaj@slackwarelinux.net.
