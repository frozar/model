      <p>Firewalls are an area of increasing interest for people
      who are connected to the Internet, and are even finding
      applications on private networks to provide enhanced
      security. This section will hopefully explain what firewalls
      are, how to use them, and how to use the facilities provided
      in the FreeBSD kernel to implement them.</p>

          <p><b>Note:</b> People often think that having a firewall
          between your internal network and the ``Big Bad
          Internet'' will solve all your security problems. It may
          help, but a poorly setup firewall system is more of a
          security risk than not having one at all. A firewall can
          add another layer of security to your systems, but it
          cannot stop a really determined cracker from penetrating
          your internal network. If you let internal security lapse
          because you believe your firewall to be impenetrable, you
          have just made the crackers job that much easier.</p>

        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN9356">10.7.1 What Is a
        Firewall?</a></h2>

        <p>There are currently two distinct types of firewalls in
        common use on the Internet today. The first type is more
        properly called a <span class="emphasis"><i class=
        "EMPHASIS">packet filtering router</i></span>, where the
        kernel on a multi-homed machine chooses whether to forward
        or block packets based on a set of rules. The second type,
        known as a <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">proxy
        server</i></span>, relies on daemons to provide
        authentication and to forward packets, possibly on a
        multi-homed machine which has kernel packet forwarding
        disabled.</p>

        <p>Sometimes sites combine the two types of firewalls, so
        that only a certain machine (known as a <span class=
        "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">bastion host</i></span>) is
        allowed to send packets through a packet filtering router
        onto an internal network. Proxy services are run on the
        bastion host, which are generally more secure than normal
        authentication mechanisms.</p>

        <p>FreeBSD comes with a kernel packet filter (known as
        IPFW), which is what the rest of this section will
        concentrate on. Proxy servers can be built on FreeBSD from
        third party software, but there is such a variety of proxy
        servers available that it would be impossible to cover them
        in this section.</p>

        <div class="SECT3">
          <h3 class="SECT3"><a name=
          "FIREWALLS-PACKET-FILTERS">10.7.1.1 Packet Filtering
          Routers</a></h3>

          <p>A router is a machine which forwards packets between
          two or more networks. A packet filtering router has an
          extra piece of code in its kernel which compares each
          packet to a list of rules before deciding if it should be
          forwarded or not. Most modern IP routing software has
          packet filtering code within it that defaults to
          forwarding all packets. To enable the filters, you need
          to define a set of rules for the filtering code so it can
          decide if the packet should be allowed to pass or
          not.</p>

          <p>To decide whether a packet should be passed on, the
          code looks through its set of rules for a rule which
          matches the contents of this packets headers. Once a
          match is found, the rule action is obeyed. The rule
          action could be to drop the packet, to forward the
          packet, or even to send an ICMP message back to the
          originator. Only the first match counts, as the rules are
          searched in order. Hence, the list of rules can be
          referred to as a ``rule chain''.</p>

          <p>The packet matching criteria varies depending on the
          software used, but typically you can specify rules which
          depend on the source IP address of the packet, the
          destination IP address, the source port number, the
          destination port number (for protocols which support
          ports), or even the packet type (UDP, TCP, ICMP,
          etc).</p>

          <h3 class="SECT3"><a name=
          "FIREWALLS-PROXY-SERVERS">10.7.1.2 Proxy Servers</a></h3>

          <p>Proxy servers are machines which have had the normal
          system daemons (<b class="APPLICATION">telnetd</b>, <b
          class="APPLICATION">ftpd</b>, etc) replaced with special
          servers. These servers are called <span class=
          "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">proxy servers</i></span>
          as they normally only allow onward connections to be
          made. This enables you to run (for example) a proxy
          telnet server on your firewall host, and people can
          telnet in to your firewall from the outside, go through
          some authentication mechanism, and then gain access to
          the internal network (alternatively, proxy servers can be
          used for signals coming from the internal network and
          heading out).</p>

          <p>Proxy servers are normally more secure than normal
          servers, and often have a wider variety of authentication
          mechanisms available, including ``one-shot'' password
          systems so that even if someone manages to discover what
          password you used, they will not be able to use it to
          gain access to your systems as the password instantly
          expires. As they do not actually give users access to the
          host machine, it becomes a lot more difficult for someone
          to install backdoors around your security system.</p>

          <p>Proxy servers often have ways of restricting access
          further, so that only certain hosts can gain access to
          the servers, and often they can be set up so that you can
          limit which users can talk to which destination machine.
          Again, what facilities are available depends largely on
          what proxy software you choose.</p>

        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN9379">10.7.2 What Does IPFW
        Allow Me to Do?</a></h2>

        <p>IPFW, the software supplied with FreeBSD, is a packet
        filtering and accounting system which resides in the
        kernel, and has a user-land control utility, <a href=
        "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ipfw&sektion=8"><span
         class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
        "REFENTRYTITLE">ipfw</span>(8)</span></a>. Together, they
        allow you to define and query the rules currently used by
        the kernel in its routing decisions.</p>

        <p>There are two related parts to IPFW. The firewall
        section allows you to perform packet filtering. There is
        also an IP accounting section which allows you to track
        usage of your router, based on similar rules to the
        firewall section. This allows you to see (for example) how
        much traffic your router is getting from a certain machine,
        or how much WWW (World Wide Web) traffic it is
        forwarding.</p>

        <p>As a result of the way that IPFW is designed, you can
        use IPFW on non-router machines to perform packet filtering
        on incoming and outgoing connections. This is a special
        case of the more general use of IPFW, and the same commands
        and techniques should be used in this situation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="SECT2">
        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN9390">10.7.3 Enabling IPFW on
        FreeBSD</a></h2>

        <p>As the main part of the IPFW system lives in the kernel,
        you will need to add one or more options to your kernel
        configuration file, depending on what facilities you want,
        and recompile your kernel. See "Reconfiguring your Kernel"
        (<a href="kernelconfig.html">Chapter 9</a>) for more
        details on how to recompile your kernel.</p>

        <p>There are currently three kernel configuration options
        relevant to IPFW:</p>

        <div class="VARIABLELIST">
          <dl>
            <dt><tt class="LITERAL">options IPFIREWALL</tt></dt>

              filtering.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><tt class="LITERAL">options
            IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE</tt></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Enables code to allow logging of packets through
              <a href=

              <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
              "REFENTRYTITLE">syslogd</span>(8)</span></a>. Without
              this option, even if you specify that packets should
              be logged in the filter rules, nothing will
              happen.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><tt class="LITERAL">options
            IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT=10</tt></dt>

              hostile environments in which you want to log
              firewall activity, but do not want to be open to a
              denial of service attack via syslog flooding.</p>

              <p>When a chain entry reaches the packet limit
              specified, logging is turned off for that particular
              entry. To resume logging, you will need to reset the
              associated counter using the <a href=
              "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ipfw&sektion=8">

        <p>The configuration of the IPFW software is done through

        syntax for this command looks quite complicated, but it is
        relatively simple once you understand its structure.</p>

        <p>There are currently four different command categories
        used by the utility: addition/deletion, listing, flushing,
        and clearing. Addition/deletion is used to build the rules
        that control how packets are accepted, rejected, and
        logged. Listing is used to examine the contents of your
        rule set (otherwise known as the chain) and packet counters
        (accounting). Flushing is used to remove all entries from
        the chain. Clearing is used to zero out one or more
        accounting entries.</p>

          will allow any address in a class C subnet (in this case,

          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>When initially setting up your firewall, unless you have
        a test bench setup where you can configure your firewall
        host in a controlled environment, it is strongly recommend
        you use the logging version of the commands and enable
        logging in the kernel. This will allow you to quickly
        identify problem areas and cure them without too much
        disruption. Even after the initial setup phase is complete,
        I recommend using the logging for `deny' as it allows
        tracing of possible attacks and also modification of the
        firewall rules if your requirements alter.</p>

            log line will be generated for every packet that passes
            through the firewall, so large FTP/http transfers, etc,
            will really slow the system down. It also increases the

          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>You should enable your firewall from <tt class=
        "FILENAME">/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> or <tt class=
        "FILENAME">/etc/rc.conf</tt>. The associated manual page
        explains which knobs to fiddle and lists some preset
        firewall configurations. If you do not use a preset
        configuration, <tt class="COMMAND">ipfw list</tt> will
        output the current ruleset into a file that you can pass to

        "FILENAME">/etc/rc.conf</tt> to enable your firewall, it is
        important to make sure your firewall is enabled before any
        IP interfaces are configured.</p>

        <p>The next problem is what your firewall should actually
        <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">do</i></span>!
        This is largely dependent on what access to your network
        you want to allow from the outside, and how much access to
        the outside world you want to allow from the inside. Some
        general rules are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Block all incoming access to ports below 1024 for
            TCP. This is where most of the security sensitive
            services are, like finger, SMTP (mail) and telnet.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Block <span class="emphasis"><i class=
            "EMPHASIS">all</i></span> incoming UDP traffic. There
            are very few useful services that travel over UDP, and
            what useful traffic there is, is normally a security
            threat (e.g. Suns RPC and NFS protocols). This has its
            disadvantages also, since UDP is a connectionless
            protocol, denying incoming UDP traffic also blocks the
            replies to outgoing UDP traffic. This can cause a
            problem for people (on the inside) using external
            archie (prospero) servers. If you want to allow access
            to archie, you will have to allow packets coming from
            ports 191 and 1525 to any internal UDP port through the
            firewall. <b class="APPLICATION">ntp</b> is another
            service you may consider allowing through, which comes
            from port 123.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Block traffic to port 6000 from the outside. Port
            6000 is the port used for access to X11 servers, and
            can be a security threat (especially if people are in
            the habit of doing <tt class="COMMAND">xhost +</tt> on
            their workstations). X11 can actually use a range of
            ports starting at 6000, the upper limit being how many
            X displays you can run on the machine. The upper limit
            as defined by RFC 1700 (Assigned Numbers) is 6063.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Check what ports any internal servers use (e.g. SQL
            servers, etc). It is probably a good idea to block
            those as well, as they normally fall outside the 1-1024
            range specified above.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="IPFW-OVERHEAD">10.7.7 IPFW
        Overhead and Optimization</a></h2>

        <p>Many people want to know how much overhead IPFW adds to
        a system. The answer to this depends mostly on your rule
        set and processor speed. For most applications dealing with
        Ethernet and small rule sets, the answer is ``negligible''.
        For those of you that need actual measurements to satisfy
        your curiosity, read on.</p>

        <p>The following measurements were made using 2.2.5-STABLE
        on a 486-66. (While IPFW has changed slightly in later
        releases of FreeBSD, it still performs with similar speed.)
        IPFW was modified to measure the time spent within the <tt
        class="LITERAL">ip_fw_chk</tt> routine, displaying the
        results to the console every 1000 packets.</p>

        <p>Two rule sets, each with 1000 rules were tested. The
        first set was designed to demonstrate a worst case scenario
        by repeating the rule:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt> <tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>ipfw add deny tcp from any to any 55555</b></tt>
</pre>

        <p>This demonstrates worst case by causing most of IPFW's
        packet check routine to be executed before finally deciding
        that the packet does not match the rule (by virtue of the
        port number). Following the 999th iteration of this rule
        was an <tt class="LITERAL">allow ip from any to
        any</tt>.</p>

        <p>The second set of rules were designed to abort the rule
        check quickly:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt> <tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>ipfw add deny ip from 1.2.3.4 to 1.2.3.4</b></tt>
</pre>

        <p>The non-matching source IP address for the above rule
        causes these rules to be skipped very quickly. As before,
        the 1000th rule was an <tt class="LITERAL">allow ip from
        any to any</tt>.</p>

        <p>The per-packet processing overhead in the former case
        was approximately 2.703ms/packet, or roughly 2.7
        microseconds per rule. Thus the theoretical packet
        processing limit with these rules is around 370 packets per
        second. Assuming 10Mbps Ethernet and a ~1500 byte packet
        size, we would only be able to achieve a 55.5% bandwidth
        utilization.</p>

        <p>For the latter case each packet was processed in
        approximately 1.172ms, or roughly 1.2 microseconds per
        rule. The theoretical packet processing limit here would be
        about 853 packets per second, which could consume 10Mbps
        Ethernet bandwidth.</p>

        <p>The excessive number of rules tested and the nature of
        those rules do not provide a real-world scenario -- they
        were used only to generate the timing information presented
        here. Here are a few things to keep in mind when building
        an efficient rule set:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Place an <tt class="LITERAL">established</tt> rule
            early on to handle the majority of TCP traffic. Do not
            put any <tt class="LITERAL">allow tcp</tt> statements
            before this rule.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Place heavily triggered rules earlier in the rule
            set than those rarely used (<span class="emphasis"><i
            class="EMPHASIS">without changing the permissiveness of
            the firewall</i></span>, of course). You can see which
            rules are used most often by examining the packet
            counting statistics with <tt class="COMMAND">ipfw -a
            l</tt>.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
