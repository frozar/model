<h1>Win32 Debug CRT Heap Internals</h1>

<p>
... by Andrew Birkett <a href="mailto:andy@nobugs.org">(andy@nobugs.org)</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>If you are lazy, skip the explanation and <a href="#table">jump to
the table</a> at the bottom of the page</b>
</p>

<p>
When you compile programs with DevStudio in debug mode, all of your
calls to malloc() and free() use a special "debug" implementation.
Rather than being blazingly fast, the debug heap concerns itself with
spotting heap errors.  It achieves this by surrounding your memory
blocks with guard bytes (aka "no mans land", 0xFD) so that it can
detect buffer overruns and underruns.  It also initialises newly
allocated memory to a fixed value (0xCD) to aid reproducability.
Finally, it sets free()d blocks to a known value (0xDD) so that it can
detect that people are writing through dangling pointers.
</p>

<p>
Mnemonics for remembering what each fill-pattern means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The newly allocated memory (0x<b>C</b>D) is <b>C</b>lean memory.</li>
  <li>The free()d memory (0x<b>D</b>D) is <b>D</b>ead memory.</li>
  <li>The guard bytes (0x<b>F</b>D) are like <b>F</b>ences around your memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The debug CRT heap defers most of the heavy work to the Win32 heap
functions HeapAlloc() and HeapFree().  Therefore, you won't see any
first-fit or "buddy system" code in the debug CRT.  The 4Gb
virtual memory space which you process has is sliced up and managed
by the Win32 heap inside kernel32.dll.
</p>

<p>
If you call malloc(8), the debug CRT will request a 48 byte block from
HeapAlloc().  It needs the extra 40 bytes to store information about
the memory blocks - such as the file/line where malloc() was called,
and space for links to the next/prev heap block.  In the <a href="#table">table below</a>, all of the debug CRT information is
colored in shades of red.
</p>

<p>
HeapAlloc() itself needs bookkeeping information.  The HeapAlloc(40)
call will, in turn, reserve a total of 80 bytes from your process's
address space.  Eight bytes of bookkeeping appear below the requested
40 bytes, and the other 32 bytes appear above it.  In the <a href="#table">table below</a>, the Win32 heap bookkeeping is colored
grey.  The memory which you get back from HeapAlloc() is always
initialised to the 4 byte pattern 0xBAADF00D. 
</p>

<p class="aside">
(As an aside, when you request pages from the VM manager via
VirtualAlloc, they are initialized to zero, so HeapAlloc is actually
doing additional work to re-initialize them to this pattern).
</p>

<p>
Once the debug CRT has got it's 40 byte block, it will fill in it's
book-keeping information.  The first 2 words are links to the previous
and next blocks on the CRT heap.  The choice of names is confusing,
because the "next" pointer actually takes you the block which was
allocated <i>before</i> this one chronologically, while the "previous"
pointer takes you to the one allocated <i>subsequently</i>.  The
reason for the naming is that the linked list starts at the
last-allocated block, and progresses back in time as you follow "next"
links.  The debug CRT heap also internally maintains pointers to the
first and last blocks (_pFirstBlock and _pLastBlock) to allow
heap-checking code to traverse all the blocks.
</p>

<p>
If the filename and line number of the malloc() call are known, they
are stored in the next 2 words.  Following that, the next word tells
you how many bytes were requested.  The next word gives a type field.
Usually this is "1" which means a normal block, allocated by
malloc/new.  It will be "2" for blocks allocate by the CRT for its own
internal purposes, and "0" for blocks which have been freed but not
released back to the win32 heap (see below for more info).  The final
word is a simple counter which increases everytime an allocation is made.
</p>

<p>
Surrounding the 8-byte malloc()'d memory there are areas of "no mans
land".  These are filled with a known value (0xFD), and when the block
is free()d, the CRT will check that they still have the right value.
If they've changed, then your program contains an error.
Unfortunately, the corruption may have happened a long time ago.  You
can use Purify or Boundschecker to stop at the corruption point, or if
you don't fancy spending any money, you can wait a few days until I
write an article telling you how to do it using only a bit of
ingenuity!
</p>

<p>
The eight bytes which were originally requested are initialised with
0xCD.  If you see this pattern appearing in your variables, you have
forgotten to initialise something.
</p>

<p>
When you call free() on the 8-byte block, the CRT sets the whole
48-byte block (including its bookkeeping) to 0xDDDDDDDD.  This means
that it can tell if the block gets subsequently altered (ie. via a
dangling pointer) by checking that the pattern is still there.
</p>

<p>
At this point, two things can happen.  Normally, HeapFree() will be
called to return the block to the win32 heap.  This causes the block
to be overwritten with the win32 heap's "freed memory" pattern, which
is 0xFEEEFEEE.  Note that the debug CRT does not maintain any "free
lists" - all of that is done within the black box of HeapFree().
</p>

<p>
However, you can also tell the debug heap to keep hold of free()d
blocks.  You do this by passing the _CRTDBG_DELAY_FREE_MEM_DF flag to
_CrtSetDbgFlag().  In this case, the debug CRT will keep hold of the
block.  This is useful if you are trying to track down a dangling
pointer error, since memory blocks will not be reused and you should
expect them to remain filled with 0xDDDDDDDD unless someone is writing
to the free()d block.  You can call _CrtCheckMemory() and it will
tell you if any of these values have been tampered with.
</p>

<h2>Here's an allocation I prepared earlier ...</h2>

<p>
I called malloc(8) followed by free() and stepped through the CRT
calls to see how the memory was changed.  Read the columns from left
to right, and you will see what values appear in memory at various
stages during malloc() and free().  The call to malloc(8) returned a
block at address 0x00321000, and I've included offsets from that
address so that you can find out the information for one of your
allocations.

(I've tried to helpfully color-code things.  Blue and grey is for
Win32 heap stuff, and reds are for the debug crt heap stuff.  If you
hate the color scheme, the colors are set up using CSS at the top of
this .html file - go edit them yourself!)
