 An  1855   recipe  from  Pontarlier,  France,   gives  the  following
instructions for making absinthe:


 Macerate 2.5 kilograms of dried  wormwood, 5 kilograms of anise and 5
kilograms of fennel in 95 liters  of 85 percent ethanol by volume. Let
the  mixture steep  for  at least  12 hours  in  the pot  of a  double
boiler. Add  45 liters of water  and apply heat; collect  95 liters of
distillate. To  40 liters of the  distillate, add 1  kilogram of Roman
wormwood, 1  kilogram of hyssop  and 500 grams  of lemon balm,  all of
which  have been  dried and  finely  divided.  Extract  at a  moderate
temperature, then siphon  off the liquor, filter, and  reunite it with
the remaining  55 liters of  distillate. Dilute with water  to produce
approximately   100  liters   of   absinthe  with   a  final   alcohol
concentration  of  74  percent  by  volume  (Arnold  1989,  Scientific
American).
