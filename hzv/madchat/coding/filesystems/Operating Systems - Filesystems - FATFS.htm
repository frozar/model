<H3>The boot record</H3>
<P>After the partition table, the boot-record is the second most important 
information on your hard drive. Most commercial applications for disc-recovery 
are capable of regenerating destroyed boot-records, but perhaps you want to try 
your luck (don't!). If that is the case the structure is like this:</P>
<P>The first three bytes contain a JUMP instruction to skip the information and 
make extensions possible (because the MBR loads this sector into memory and 
transfers execution to it). Following the jump is the record itself:</P>

<P>The OEM ID describes the program, that created the boot record. This is often 
"MSWIN4.0" (Win95), "IBM 20.0" (OS/2), "MSDOS5.0" (MS-DOS later than 4)</P>
<P>Bytes per sector is almost always 512.</P>
<P>Sectors per cluster is a bit more difficult. Clusters are in the FATFS the 
basic allocation unit, meaning that all files occupy at least one cluster (size 
up to 32KB). The lost space is called slack-space. To determine the size of each 
cluster Microsoft published this table:</P>

<P>Reserved sectors is the sectors before the FAT's. The value is at least 1 
(the boot-record).</P>
<P>FAT's is the number of FAT's on the drive. Usually, this is 2.</P>
<P>Root Entries is the number of files/directories available in the root 
directory. As far as I know, this is often 512, but DOS uses 1 for the 
volume-label, meaning you actually only can have 511 files in your root 
directory. (my OS/2-bootdrive has 544 entries).</P>
<P>Sectors (small) is the size of the partition in sectors. If the number is too 
large to fit in this field, the size will be placed in "sectors (large)" and 
this field is 0.</P>

<P>Sectors per FAT. Now, this is where it gets complicated - I used good old 
math to solve this one, even though I have a feeling it is completely 
unnecessary.</P>
<P>Assume:<BR>To is the total amount of sectors,<BR>Fo is the amount of free 
sectors for data<BR>Fs is the size of one FAT in sectors<BR>Cs is the cluster 
size<BR>Ss is the sector size<BR>Rs is the reserved sectors before the 
FAT's<BR>Re is the entries in the root-directory<BR>Ds is the size of a entry 
(=32 bytes)<BR>The size of the FAT must equal the free amount of sectors divided 
by the cluster size in sectors multiplied by two (because FAT-16 uses 2 bytes to 
describe 1 cluster, but FAT-12 only uses 1½ byte for each cluster) divided by 
the sector size (of course rounded up, but we'll overlook that for now)</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>     2 *  Fo
Fs = -------
     Cs * Ss
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The free amount of sectors must be the total amount minus the FAT's, the Root 
Directory and the Reserved Sectors</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Fo = To - 2 * Fs - Rs - Re*Ds/Ss
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Lets solve that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>     2 *  ( To - 2 * Fs - Rs - Re*Ds/Ss)               2 ( To - Rs - Re*Ds/Ss )
Fs = -----------------------------------   ==&gt;   Fs =  ------------------------
               Cs * Ss                                        Cs * Ss + 4
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And then you just put in your values (remember to round the result up 
(131.02=132) ). And then verify the result by calculating how many cluster you 
got on your drive and how many the FAT can handle.</P>
<P>An alternative and a lot simpler way is to take the total amount of sectors 
in the partition, divide it by the number of clusters per sector and divide it 
by the amount of FAT-entries per sector. The calculation seems simpler, explains 
why you cannot make a partition larger than 509MB with a clustersize of 16 
sectors, is a lot simpler to program, but it is not such a mathematically 
optimal approach as the previously described method - therefore it is probably 
the way DOS calculates it.</P>
<P>Sectors Per Track and Heads you got to get from some kind of information 
program, e.g. INT 13h, service 08h - see <A 
href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/pierrelib/filesystems/fat16.html#1">appendix 
1</A>.</P>
<P>Hidden sectors is the number of sectors <B>before</B> the boot-record on the 
physical disk (often equal to the RelativeSectors-field in the partition table). 
It is necessary to boot correctly.</P>
<P>Sectors (large) contains the number of sectors on the partition if "sectors 
(small)" could not handle the amount.</P>
<P>Now for all the starred entries. The starred entries are part of the 
so-called extended BIOS parameter block, which, as far as I know is used on all 
FAT drives.</P>
<P>The physical drive number contains the number which the drive is assigned. It 
seems that this number is either 80h for hard disks or 00h for floppy drives, 
and is actually assigned at run-time except if the drive is to be used as a 
boot-drive. If you have two partitions on a drive they'll be numbered 80h and 
81h and your floppy drives is 00h and 01h.</P>
<P>Current Head should be without importance except for users of Windows NT, 
please refer to Microsoft Knowledge Base for more info.</P>
<P>Signature must be either 28h or 29h for Windows NT to recognize the 
drive.</P>
<P>ID should just be a random number different from other drives, but has no 
valuable meaning.</P>
<P>Volume Label you should be able to figure out without my help :)</P>
<P>System ID defines which file-system is in use on the disk. This is either 
FAT12 ("FAT") or "FAT16" depending on the size and media (for HDD 16-bit is most 
common, except for disk with less than 15MB capacity).</P>
<P>And here follows the executable code which makes the system load an operating 
system and start executing it.</P>
<P><I>And by the way, if you want to track a boot-record, the last two bytes in 
the boot-record are always 55h AAh.</I></P>
<H3>The FAT</H3>
<P>When using the FATFS you actually have a quite simple point of view on the 
drive (which supports the claim that Gates designed it during a 5-days stay at a 
hotel). Just think of the drive as a series of cells (clusters). When a file is 
allocated, you have a number, that points to the first cluster. In the FAT you 
have a list of all the clusters on the disk and on a clusters entry the number 
of the next cluster in the chain is written. So, if you have a file, MYFILE.TXT, 
which starts at cluster 3 and continues in cluster 5, 6, 7 and finally 9, the 
FAT would look like this:</P>
<P>[2] ?<BR>[3] 5<BR>[4] ?<BR>[5] 6<BR>[6] 7<BR>[7] 9<BR>[8] ?<BR>[9] 
&lt;EOF&gt; </P>
<P>As far as I know, it is illegal to do backwards references, meaning entry 5 
could never contain a number less than 6.</P>
<P>This means that the FAT is a very important tool in recreating the contents 
of a file, and therefore a drive with a destroyed FAT is quite badly hit. The 
developers of the FATFS saw this flaw and made two copies of the chain, but 
placed right after each other instead of placing them far from each other to 
protect them from corruption if a disk-crash happened (of course this would have 
caused performance loss and never protected them from misbehaving 
applications).</P>
<P>The size of each field in the FAT is either 16-bit or 12-bit giving 
respectively 65535 and 4096 clusters as the max. size of a media. The 12-bit 
version is only used on diskettes and drives with a size of less than 16MB.</P>
<P>A series of numbers are reserved for internal use. Depending on the size of 
each entry in the FAT (12- or 16-bit), the numbers are as follows:</P>
<TABLE class=boxed>
  <CAPTION>Media Descriptors </CAPTION>
  <TBODY>
  <TR class=head>
    <TH>Number</TH>

  <TR class=od>
    <TD>FF8-FFF / FFF8-FFFF</TD>
    <TD>End of file</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>To establish the position of the first cluster on your drive, you just add up 
the reserved sectors, the two FATs and the size of the root directory. To verify 
it you could track the first directory entry and compare it to the 
cluster-boundary.</P>
<P><I>Since cluster 0 and 1 are reserved they contain [EOF] [EOF] (on HDD) or 
[reserved] [EOF] (on FDD). In hex it becomes (on HDD) F8 FF FF FF ... or (on 
FDD) F0 FF FF.</I></P>
<H3>The Directory Entries</H3>
<P>Directory entries(DE) contains the entry into the chain of clusters and the 
filename. The perhaps most important DE is the root directory, because it 
contains cluster indexes that points to all sub-dirs. The location of the 
root-dir can easily be established, as it is positioned following the FAT's, so 
just add up the values from the boot record. But a knock-out of the root-dir is 
actually not very bad, because as you probably noticed, all directories contain 
two entries "." and "..", and we can track those ones, since they always will be 
positioned in the beginning of a cluster if the cluster contains a 
directory.</P>
<P>MS-DOS always allocate one cluster to contain DE's whenever you create a 
directory. This is probably the case because directories are nothing more than 
files that DOS can interpret as directories, and therefore the same mechanism 
used to tie files together is used to tie large directories with sizes larger 
than one cluster together (on 8K clusters this is rarely used since a directory 
can contain 254 files, at least for DOS, because Win95 uses additional DE to 
store long filenames).</P>

<P>(*) this only applies to users of OS/2, since OS/2 uses a file in the 
root-directory called EA DATA. SF, which contains the extended attributes for 
files (like long names and file types or icon positions in folders). I don't 
know if any scaling-factor is involved or if it is only a index to a record in 
the EA-file. In non-OS/2 systems this field should be zeroed out. Be aware that 
Win95 uses the reserved area for extra data storage and uses directory entries 
for storage of long filenames, that do not correspond to the table showed above 
- more about that in <A

<P>Entry Cluster in chain is the first cluster, that makes up the file. If the 
attributes.directory flag is set, this field points to a new directory 
entry.</P>
<P>Size of file in bytes, I believe, needs no explanation except the fact it can 
be a valuable resource in recovering damaged files since we can calculate how 
many clusters the file is supposed to consist of.</P>
<P>Lets learn by example, we have a file, MYFILE.TXT, with a size of 9948 bytes 
dated 1997-03-21:17.48.22 and ReadOnly plus Archive active starting in cluster 
34656, lets analyze...</P>
<P>The DE for this file would look like this:</P><PRE>"MYFILE  TXT" 21 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 -- -- -- -- 60 87 DC 26 00 00

<H3>Tips</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Run Norton SpeedDisk / Microsoft Defrag or a similar program to defragment 
  the filestructure often (you can guess how much the FATFS must fragment files 
  on disk unless it has a very good algorithm for finding free-space). This will 
  make a recovery from a seriously messed-up disk a lot easier, since you can 
  count on files being positioned so as the clusters will follow each other. 
  <LI>Use Microsoft ScanDisk / Norton DiskDoctor to trap small damages before 
  they grow large 
  <LI>Back-up your important information just once in a while... (I know its 
  hard - but your going to be be glad!) 
  <LI>Don't mess with these sectors </LI></UL>
