<H3><A name=scope></A>Purpose and Scope </H3>
<P>While the CD-ROM media provides for cost-effective software distribution, the 
existing ISO 9660 file system contains a number of restrictions which interfere 
with simple and efficient distribution of files on a CD-ROM. </P>
<P>The read-only nature of CD-ROM media has led content authors to continue to 
use traditional magnetic media as their main avenue for creating applications. 
Each of the existing file systems for magnetic media contain various features 
which can not be represented on CD-ROM media using an unenhanced version of ISO 
9660. </P>
<P>As content authors attempt to transfer their applications to the CD-ROM, they 
are likely to find that some of their work cannot be distributed on the CD-ROM 
media due to restrictions in the ISO 9660 format. This frustrates some content 
authors. </P>
<P>Because the CD-ROM media is mainly a distribution media, rather than a 
creative (read/write) media, it is necessary for the CD-ROM file system to 
support a superset of the creative media features. This fundamental flaw in the 
design of ISO 9660 has prompted several operating systems vendors to extend ISO 
9660 in several ways. Some examples are Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol and 
Apple's use of the System Use Area to store finder flags. </P>
<P>Some of the ISO 9660 problems which are addressed by this specification 
include: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Character Set limitations. 
  <LI>File Name Length limitations 
  <LI>Directory Tree Depth limitations 
  <LI>Directory Name Format limitations 
  <LI>Wide Character (16-bit character) ambiguities </LI></UL>
<P>The general design approach used in the Joliet specification is to relax 
restrictions and resolve ambiguities in the ISO 9660:1988 specification so the 
practical goals can be met. </P>
<H3><A name=overview></A>Overview </H3>
<P>The Joliet specification utilizes the supplementary volume descriptor (SVD) 
feature of ISO 9660 to specify a set of files recorded within the Unicode 
character set. </P>
<P>The ISO 10646 character set specification may be identified by an ISO 2022 
escape sequence. By recording this escape sequence in an ISO 9660 SVD, this 
technique for identifying the Unicode SVD is compliant with the ISO 9660 
specification. It also retains interchange by not disrupting the files 
referenced through the primary volume descriptor (PVD). </P>
<P>All that remains is to resolve minor technical ambiguities within ISO 9660 
which arise as the result of the use of wide characters. </P>
<P>Because the use of this particular escape sequence in an ISO 9660 SVD is 
unprecedented up to this time, several of the restrictions which are imposed by 
ISO 9660 may be relaxed without significantly disrupting information interchange 
between existing systems from a practical standpoint. </P>
<P>This design approach has several benefits. For instance, the use of the 
existing ISO 9660 standard allows for straightforward integration with existing 
extensions to ISO 9660. The designs for the System Use Sharing Protocol, Rock 
Ridge extensions for POSIX semantics, CD-XA System Use Area Semantics, Apple's 
Finder Flags and Resource Forks, all port in a straightforward manner to the 
Joliet specification. </P>
<P>Also, the use of a new SVD eliminates the danger of breaking software 
compatibility with existing ISO 9660 systems. Existing software will simply 
ignore the Unicode SVD, and will simply use the PVD instead. This compatibility 
"safety-valve" makes the goal of relaxing the file system's restrictions easier. 
</P>
<P>This document describes how a CD-ROM may be constructed so that names on the 
volume can be recorded in Unicode while remaining in compliance with ISO 9660. 
The particular ISO 10646 character sets used here are UCS-2 Level 1, UCS-2 Level 
2, and UCS-2 Level 3. </P>
<P>The basic strategy of CD-ROM volume recognition is the Volume Recognition 
Sequence, which is a sequence of volume descriptors, recorded one per sector, 
starting at Sector 16 in the first track of the last session on the disc. A 
receiving system reads these sectors and chooses a particular volume descriptor 
from the sequence. This volume descriptor acts as a kind of anchor upon which 
the remainder of the volume is constructed. </P>
<H3><A name=terms>Terminology and Notation</A></H3>
<P>Joliet is based on the ISO 9660:1988 standard. Unless defined in this 
document, the terminology used shall be as defined in ISO 9660:1988. </P>
<P>The following notation is used in this document. </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Decimal and Hexadecimal Notation 
  <UL>
    <LI>Numbers in decimal notation are represented by decimal digits, namely 0 
    to 9. 
    <LI>Numbers in hexadecimal notation are represented by hexadecimal digits, 
    namely 0 to 9 and A to F, shown in parentheses. For instance, the 
    hexadecimal number D0 shall be written as (D0). </LI></UL>
  <LI>A literal sequence of ASCII characters will be represented by those 
  characters within single quotes. For instance, 'ABC' means the byte sequence 
  (41)(42)(43). 
  <LI>References to characters in the ISO 2022 escape sequence will be given in 
  comma-separated decimal nibble/nibble format, in hexadecimal format, and as 
  ASCII characters, with equal signs between each format, all enclosed within 
  parenthesis. For instance, the 3-byte ISO 2022 escape sequence for Shift-JIS 
  is (2/4, 2/11, 3/10 = (24)(2B)(3A)= '$+:'). </LI></UL>

<H2>Joliet Recording Specification</H2>
<H3><A name=change></A>Change Summary</H3>
<P>The Joliet specification resolves the following ISO 9660 ambiguities for 
UCS-2 volumes: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Use a SVD with a UCS-2 (UNICODE) Escape Sequence. 
  <LI>The UCS-2 escape sequences used are: (25)(2F)(40), (25)(2F)(43), or 
  (25)(2F)(45). 
  <LI>The default setting of bit 0 of the SVD "Volume Flags Field" is ZERO. 
  <LI>The Unicode Wide characters shall be recorded in "Big Endian" (Motorola) 
  format. 
  <LI>Special Directory Identifiers are recorded as single byte names containing 
  (00) or (01). 
  <LI>SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 are encoded using an equivalent 16-bit code 
  point. 
  <LI>Sort ordering is unchanged, except that all justification pad bytes are to 
  be set to (00). </LI></UL>
<P>The Joliet specification recommends that several ISO 9660 restrictions be 
lifted on UCS-2 volumes. The Joliet specification allows for the following 
interchange rules: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>The File or Directory Identifiers may be up to 128 bytes (64 unicode 
  characters) in length. 
  <LI>Directory Identifiers may contain file name extensions. 
  <LI>The Directory Hierarchy may be recorded deeper than 8 levels. 
  <LI>The volume recognition sequence supports multisession. This is compatible 
  with the CD-Bridge specification. </LI></UL>
<P>The Joliet specification may be extended through the use of the following 
specifications: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Mode 2 Form 2 extents and CD-DA extents, ("System Description CD-ROM XA") 
  <LI>System Use Sharing Protocol (not explicitly specified here)

<H3>Sort Ordering</H3>
<P>ISO 9660 specifies the order of path table records within a path table, and

<P>The only change required is to redefine the value of the sort justification 
pad byte to zero (00). </P>
<P>Simply put, comparing the byte contents in all positions remains a suitable

<H3><A name=multisession></A>Joliet for Multisession Media </H3>
<P>Multisession Recordings are Received </P>
<P>When provided with CD-ROM reader hardware with multisession capability, 
Joliet receiving systems shall receive media recorded using the multisession 
recording technique. </P>
<P>The details of this technique are provided below </P>
<P><B>Logical Sector Addressing on Multisession Recordings</B> </P>
<P>Each sector on the media is assigned a unique Logical Sector Address. </P>
<P>Logical Sector Addresses zero and above increase linearly across the surface 
of the disc, regardless of session boundaries. </P>
<P>Logical Sector Address zero references the sector with Minute:Second:Frame 
address 00:02:00 in the first session. All other Logical Sector Addresses are 
relative to Minute:Second:Frame address 00:02:00 in the first session. </P>
<P>The conversion between Logical Sector Addresses and Minute:Second:Frame 
addresses is Logical Sector Address = (((Minute*60)+Seconds)*75) - 150. </P>
<P>Simply put, the Logical Sector Address on a multisession disc describes a 
flat address space. </P>
<P><B>Multisession Addressability</B> </P>
<P>The data area for a volume may span multiple sessions. </P>
<P>For example, if a disc is recorded with 3 sessions, the directory hierarchy 
described by a volume descriptor in session 3 may reference logical sectors 
recorded in session 1, 2, or 3. </P>
<P><B>Multisession Volume Recognition Sequence</B> </P>
<P>The Volume Recognition Sequence shall begin at the 16th logical sector of the 
first track of the last session on the disc. </P>
<P>This volume recognition sequence supersedes all other volume recognition 
sequences on the disc. The interpretation of the Volume Recognition Sequence is 
otherwise unchanged. </P>
<P>For example, consider a disc that contains 3 sessions, where session 1 starts 
at 00:00:00, session 2 starts at 10:00:00, and session 3 starts at 20:00:00. The 
Volume Recognition Sequence for this disc would start at Minute:Second:Frame 
address 20:00:16. </P>
<P>This technique is compatible with the CD-Bridge multisession technique. </P>
<P><B>Track Modes and Sector Forms</B> </P>
<P>The data area for a Joliet volume on a CD-ROM shall be comprised of either 
Mode 1 or Mode 2 Form 1 sectors. CD-ROM media utilizing the multisession 
recording techniques outlined above may not contain any Mode 1 sectors anywhere 
on the media. Mode 1 sectors are allowed only on single-session media. </P>
<P>Mode 2 Form 2 sectors and CD-Digital Audio tracks may be recorded on the same 
media as a Joliet volume. In this case, the CD-XA extensions to Joliet may be 
utilized to identify Mode 2 Form 2 extents and CD-Digital Audio extents. </P>
<P>CD-Digital Audio tracks may not be recorded in sessions 2 and higher. If any 
CD-Digital Audio tracks are recorded, all the CD-Digital Audio tracks shall be 
recorded in the first session. </P>
<H3><A name=_Toc305607052></A><A name=cdxa></A>CD-XA Extensions to Joliet </H3>
<P>CD-ROM discs utilizing the Joliet extensions to ISO 9660 and which also 
identify mode 2 form 2 extents or CD-Digital Audio extents shall be marked with 
a CD-ROM XA Label as specified in "System Description CD-XA" section 2.1. </P>
<P>The CD-ROM XA Label shall be located at offset 1024 (byte position 1025) in 
the Joliet Supplementary Volume Descriptor. The identifying signature 'CD-XA001' 
shall be recorded starting at offset 1024 in the Joliet Supplementary Volume 
Descriptor. This identifying signature is equivalent to the hex bytes 
(43)(44)(2D)(58)(41)(30)(30)(31). </P>
<P>Mode 2 form 2 extents shall be identified using recording rules outlined in 
"System Description CD-XA", section 2.7. In this case, bit 12 of the Attributes 
field of the "XA System Use Information" shall be set to one to identify that 
the file contains mode 2 form 2 sectors. See below for additional information 
regarding Data Length. </P>
<P>CD-Digital Audio extents shall be identified using recording rules outlined 
in "System Description CD-XA", section 2.7. In this case, bit 14 of the 
Attributes field of the "XA System Use Information" shall be set to one to 
identify that the file is comprised of an extent of CD-Digital Audio. See below 
for additional information regarding Data Length. </P>
<P>If a file is marked such that either bit 12 is set to one or bit 14 is set to 
one in the Attributes field of the "XA System Use Information", then the Data 
Length field of the Directory Record shall be set to 2048 times the number of 
sectors contained in the extent. </P>
<P>See ISO 9660:1988 section 9.1.4. </P>
<H3><A name=_Toc305607053></A><A name=other></A>Other Extensions to Joliet </H3>
<P>The Joliet Extensions to ISO 9660 are designed to coexist with other 
extensions such as the "System Use Sharing Protocol" and "RockRidge Interchange 
Protocol". However, these protocols are not an integral part of the Joliet 
specification. </P>
<P>The method used to integrate these other protocols into Joliet is not defined 
here. </P>
