</font></p><p><font face="Century Gothic">All programs make extensive use of the stack at run-time.  If you program
in a high level language you may not realise that the compiler will be 
making use of the stack at all.  But as an assembler programmer you will
be fully aware of this since the stack is one of the main tools at your
disposal.  By using it directly, you can realise its full potential in your
programs.  Although you can program in assembler without knowing anything 
about the stack, it is helpful to know and understand something about it.

</font></p><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Features and advantages of the stack</font></h3>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Basically the stack is an area of dwords (32 bit data areas) in memory
at run-time which your application can use to store data temporarily.  It
has certain features and real advantages over other types of memory storage 
(data sections and run-time memory areas).  They are:-
</font></p><ul>
<li><font face="Century Gothic">The processor writes to and reads from the stack very rapidly since it
is optimised to do so.
</font></li><li><font face="Century Gothic">The simple instructions PUSH and POP can be used to write to and read
from the stack, and these instructions are very compact being only one byte 
each when using registers or five bytes when using memory labels or
pointers to memory addresses.
</font></li><li><font face="Century Gothic">Under Windows, the stack is enlarged dynamically at run-time in 4K
chunks.  This avoids memory wastage.
</font></li></ul>

<font face="Century Gothic"><a name="pract"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Practical uses for the stack<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack1_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">The stack can be used to:-
</font><ul>
<li><font face="Century Gothic">Preserve register values in functions: <a href="#presr">example</a>.
</font></li><li><font face="Century Gothic">Preserve data in memory: <a href="#presd">example</a>.
</font></li><li><font face="Century Gothic">Move data around without using registers: <a href="#movd">example</a>.
</font></li><li><font face="Century Gothic">Reverse data order: <a href="#revd">example</a>.
</font></li><li><font face="Century Gothic">Call other functions and return back afterwards: <a href="#callr">example</a>.
</font></li><li><font face="Century Gothic">Pass parameters to functions: <a href="#passp">example</a>.
</font></li></ul>

<font face="Century Gothic"><a name="point"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">The stack pointer: ESP register<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack1_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">The register ESP (literally "extended stack pointer") holds the top of 
the stack. This is the point where the instructions which use the stack 
(PUSH, POP, CALL and RET) actually use the stack.  More about this later.
<br>The register EBP (literally "extended base pointer") is traditionally
moved by the programmer to a particular place on the stack at any one time, so 
that data on the stack can be read from and written to using <i>base index addressing</i>.
For example in the instruction MOV EAX,[EBP+8h] the register EBP is used
as an index to an area of the stack and this instruction will move a dword 
from 8 bytes further
down the stack into the register EAX.  The traditional use of EBP for this
purpose comes from the days of 16-bit processing.  Under 16-bits the register
was just "BP" holding 16-bits of data and unlike other registers unless a 
segment override was used it always addressed the stack in memory.  Now 
under 32 bits, segments have been abolished and each program runs in its
own 4GB of address space.  EBP therefore can address the whole of this
address space and is not limited to addressing the stack unless an override
is used.  It can therefore
now be used as a general purpose register, but because of this history
it is still used to address 
particular areas of the stack mainly to access parameters passed to function
and callback routines and to address local data.

<a name="pushpop"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">PUSHing data onto, and POPing data from, the stack<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack1_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic"><img src=".usstack1_files/plate3.gif" height="79" width="60" align="left">The stack can be 
visualised as a caterer's plate dispenser.  This works on a "last in first
out" basis.  The last plate pushed on the dispenser using the PUSH instruction
will be the first one removed using the POP instruction.  The stack pointer
in ESP always points to this top plate.
</font><p><font face="Century Gothic">Lets look at this in a more traditional form.  Suppose the value of
ESP is 64FE3Ch and you have the following instructions in your source code:-
</font></p><pre><font face="Century Gothic">PUSH 2
PUSH [hWnd]
PUSH ADDR STRING
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">Then after these three instructions ESP would be 64FE30h (that is 12 
bytes or 3 dwords less in value) and the stack would look like this:-
</font><p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#ffffff">
<tbody><tr>
<td width="20%" align="right"><font size="-1">ESP is here &#8594;</font></td>
<td width="10%" bordercolor="#000000" align="center"><font size="-1">64FE30h</font></td>
<td width="30%" align="left"><font size="-1">address of STRING</font></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
</td>
<td bordercolor="#000000" align="center"><font size="-1">64FE34h</font></td>
<td><font size="-1">value held by hWnd</font></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
</td>
<td bordercolor="#000000" align="center"><font size="-1">64FE38h</font></td>
<td><font size="-1">the number 2</font></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
</td>
<td bordercolor="#000000" align="center"><font size="-1">64FE3Ch</font></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p><font face="Century Gothic">Note that each PUSH instruction <i>decreases</i> the value of ESP 
by 4 bytes. 
<br>Another thing to note is that since ESP points to the last dword PUSHed
on the stack, the next PUSH actually writes to ESP-4h.  This is done by
the processor reducing ESP by four and then writing the dword to the
address then contained within ESP.
</font></p><p><font face="Century Gothic">Now lets try some POPping.  Using the same values on the stack, lets
use the following instructions:-
</font></p><pre><font face="Century Gothic">POP EAX
POP EBX
POP ECX
</font></pre>

<font face="Century Gothic">Then after these three instructions the stack would look like this:-
</font><p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#ffffff">
<tbody><tr>
<td width="20%"></td>
<td width="10%" bordercolor="#000000" align="center"><font size="-1">64FE30h</font></td>
<td width="30%" align="left"><font size="-1">address of STRING</font></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
</td>
<td bordercolor="#000000" align="center"><font size="-1">64FE34h</font></td>
<td><font size="-1">value held by hWnd</font></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
</td>
<td bordercolor="#000000" align="center"><font size="-1">64FE38h</font></td>
<td><font size="-1">the number 2</font></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="right"><font size="-1">ESP is here &#8594;</font></td>
<td bordercolor="#000000" align="center"><font size="-1">64FE3Ch</font></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p><font face="Century Gothic">The first thing to note here is that after these three instructions ESP 
is back at 64FE3Ch.  This means that ESP has been restored to equilibrium.
This is an important concept, see <a href="#equil">below</a>.
<br>The register EAX now holds the address of STRING, EBX holds the value held 
by hWnd and ECX holds the number 2. So the data held on the stack has been
POPed off the stack in the reverse order from the sequence in which they
were PUSHed on.
<br>Note also that the data on the stack is actually still there.  This is
because the POP instructions do not write to the stack.  They just read
data from the stack into the second part of the instruction (called the 
"operand").

<a name="presr"></a></font></p><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Preserving register values in functions<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack1_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">Programs written in assembler are fast because they make use of the 
registers as much as possible.  This often means however, that the 
contents of the registers at any one time have to be preserved for later use.
So for example, suppose a file handle is in EDI, and after carrying out
some calculations using EDI you will eventually need to close the file handle,
then you might preserve it like this:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">PUSH EDI                ;save file handle
CALL CALCULATE          ;make some calculations (uses EDI)
POP EDI                 ;restore file handle
CALL CLOSE_FILEHANDLE   ;close the file handle contained in EDI
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">As an alternative you could also preserve EDI within the CALCULATE 
procedure itself for example:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">CALL CALCULATE          ;make some calculations (saves EDI)
CALL CLOSE_FILEHANDLE   ;close the file handle contained in EDI
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">and the CALCULATE function would be:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">CALCULATE:
PUSH EDI                ;save file handle
.
.                       ;some code using EDI
.
POP EDI                 ;restore file handle
RET
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">Another reason why a register may need to be preserved is if a particular
function is called externally (by another function in the same program, from 
another program or by the system).  In most cases you would ensure that
the EBP, EBX, EDI and ESI are preserved.  This is certainly a requirement
of a "C" program if it calls a routine written in assembler, and it is
also a requirement of callback procedures called by Windows itself.  An 
example of such a callback procedure is a window procedure which is used
by the system to pass messages to a window in your application.  In such
circumstances you would ensure these registers are preserved by using
for example:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">PUSH EBP,EBX,EDI,ESI
.
.                       ;your code goes here
.
POP ESI,EDI,EBX,EBP
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">Of course if your code does not change these registers anyway you could
leave out some of the PUSHes and POPs, but it may possibly be regarded as
good practice anyway to include them in case you add to your code and
forget to ensure that these registers are preserved.  Note how the
POPs are all in the reverse order: this is because of the "last in, first
out" nature of the stack.  Note also in the code above, I have put the
registers in alphabetical order.  This helps to keep track of the PUSHes
and it is easy to check that the POPs are in reverse alphabetical order
too.
<br>If you prefer, in GoAsm you can use the USES statement which will preserve
and restore the registers automatically for you.

<a name="presd"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Preserving data in memory<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack1_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">Just as you can preserve the value in a register using the stack, you can
use it to preserve data in memory.  Suppose for example you have carefully
calculated the number of widgets and want to write details of the
widgets both to the screen and also to a file.  You might use the
following code:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">PUSH [NOOF_WIDGETS]     ;keep number of widgets
L2:
CALL REPORT_WIDGET      ;write details of the widget to the screen
DEC D[NOOF_WIDGETS]     ;count down the number of widgets
JNZ L2                  ;continue with next while not yet zero
POP [NOOF_WIDGETS]      ;restore the number of widgets
CALL WRITETO_FILE       ;and make a similar report to the file
</font></pre>

<font face="Century Gothic"><a name="movd"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Move data around without using registers<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack1_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">Suppose you want to move the number of widgets to another memory label.
You could use:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">MOV EAX,[NOOF_WIDGETS]
MOV [COPYOF_NOOF_WIDGETS],EAX
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">But equally effective would be:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">PUSH [NOOF_WIDGETS]
POP [COPYOF_NOOF_WIDGETS]
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">Since this makes no use of the EAX register, that register would not 
lose its value and could therefore be used elsewhere.

<a name="revd"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Reverse data order<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack1_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">You can take advantage of the "last in, first out" nature of the stack
to reverse the order of data.  One handy use for this is in writing to
the screen a value in decimal.  Here is an example (where EAX holds
the value to write to the screen in decimal and EDI holds the position
in memory of a buffer which will hold the string):-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">XOR EDX,EDX             ;zero edx
XOR ECX,ECX             ;zero ecx (used as a counter)
MOV EBX,10              ;ebx always holds the value 10
L2:
DIV EBX                 ;div edx:eax by 10 = quotient in eax, remainder in edx
PUSH EDX                ;keep result on the stack
INC ECX                 ;count how many are done
XOR EDX,EDX             ;zero edx
CMP EAX,EDX             ;see if any more to do
JNZ L2                  ;yes
L3:                     ;now reverse the order of the digits
POP EAX                 ;get next back from the stack
ADD AL,48               ;convert to ascii number
STOSB                   ;write ascii number to buffer
LOOP L3                 ;continue while ecx is not zero
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">Lets just follow this code for a moment.  Suppose the value in EAX is
123 decimal.  The first divide by ten puts 12 in EAX and 3 in EDX.  3 is
put on the stack.  The second divide by ten puts 1 in EAX and 2 in EDX.
2 is put on the stack.  The third divide puts zero in EAX and 1 in EDX.
1 is put on the stack.  The result of CMP EAX,EDX is then zero and the
code drops to the label L3.  ECX is now 3 because this has counted the 
number of digits done.  Each is now stripped off the stack in turn.  So 48 
is added to the values 1, 2 and 3 to make 49, 50 and 51 respectively.
These are written to the buffer and are the ascii characters "1", "2", and
"3" ready to be written to the screen later on.

<a name="callr"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">How CALL and RET use the stack<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack1_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">The CALL instruction is used a lot in programming.  It is used to divert
execution to a particular procedure (or "function").  When the procedure is
finished, execution continues at just after the call.  Calling procedures
helps to keep your source code clear and obvious, for example:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">MOV EAX,EDX
CALL CALCULATE_ASSETS
MOV [ASSETS],EAX           ;keep result of the call in memory
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">Here no doubt a lot of hard work is done by the CALCULATE_ASSETS procedure,
but there is no need to worry about how it works when looking at this excerpt
from the source script.
<br>Using calls also helps to keep your code modular.  The CALCULATE_ASSETS
procedure above, may also be usable in other programs.  If you like you can
regard it as an "object".  Basically this is object orientated programming.
</font><p><font face="Century Gothic">So how does the processor know where to continue processing after the call?
Well it inserts the return address on the stack! 

</font></p><p><font face="Century Gothic">Lets look at the stack when this happens.  Suppose the value of ESP is 
64FE3Ch again and you have the following instructions in your source code:-
</font></p><pre><font face="Century Gothic">401020: MOV EAX,EDX
401022: CALL CALCULATE_ASSETS
401027: MOV [ASSETS],EAX           ;keep result of the call in memory
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">I have added here the address of execution on the left hand side to illustrate
what happens.  After the first instruction of course ESP is still 64FE3Ch and 
the stack has not changed, because a MOV instruction does not affect the stack in
any way.  But when the next instruction CALL CALCULATE_ASSETS is executed
the processor PUSHes on the stack the return address 401027h.  Now in the 
CALCULATE_ASSETS procedure there is a RET instruction (return to caller) for
example:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">CALCULATE_ASSETS:
                        ;various code here
RET                     ;return to caller
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">The RET instruction causes in effect, a POP into EIP in other words whatever
is at [ESP] is given to EIP (the instruction pointer) and then ESP is increased
by 4 bytes.
<br>So lets look at the stack before, during and after these instructions:-

kept on the stack.  Now procedures often call other procedures, which often
call others and so on.  So you might have, for example:-

<font face="Century Gothic">and
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">CALCULATE_FIXEDASSETS:
                        ;various code
CALL GET_COSTVALUES

ADD ESP,4               ;make esp out of equilibrium

</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">Here each part of the task is divided into various components.  Now suppose
the procedure CALCULATE_FIXEDASSETS adds 4 to ESP by mistake.  If this
happens, when the RET instruction is executed the instruction pointer EIP will
be loaded with the wrong value and the program will crash.
</font><p><font face="Century Gothic">While a procedure is running it is often the case that ESP will have been 
moved (for example when making space on the stack for, but it is vital to 
ensure that the 
equilibrium of the stack is restored when a procedure is about to end.
When are sent on the stack this can be done
with the RET xx instruction or by adjusting ESP to suit the number of parameters.
</font></p><p><font face="Century Gothic">Stack equilibrium is also important to return to Windows in a minimalist
application.  The simplest possible Windows application which does nothing is
as follows:-
</font></p><pre><font face="Century Gothic">START:
RET
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">Where <i>START</i> is the entry point of the application.  In fact, normally
Windows <i>calls</i> your application from Kernel32.dll, and so a simple RET
ends the program quite happily.

stack to pass parameters<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack1_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">The Windows APIs expect to receive parameters on the stack.  So when you
call an API you will be PUSHing the parameters on the stack so that they
can be retrieved by the API.  So in this code:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">PUSH 1,[hButton]
CALL EnableWindow       ;enable button
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">You push on the stack the value 1 (ENABLE flag) first, followed by the handle to the
window you want to enable.  Windows uses the stdcall "C" convention for
its APIs so on return from the API the stack will be back to equilibrium.
The convention also means that the EBP,EBX,ESI and EDI are always restored
to their previous values by the API.  
</font><p><font face="Century Gothic">Another aspect of the convention
is that parameters are always pushed <i>from right to left</i>.  The
specifications for the API EnableWindow are given in the Windows Software 
Development Kit as:-
</font></p><pre><font face="Century Gothic">WINAPI
EnableWindow(
    HWND hWnd,
    BOOL bEnable);
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">In translating this to assembler, you need to read from the right hand
side first.  This may be made slightly easier if you use the INVOKE instruction
instead of CALL, since the parameters are now in the order in which they
appear in the SDK:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">INVOKE EnableWindow, [hButton], 1
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">That's all you need to know about passing parameters on the stack for
the moment, but it is covered in more detail in <a href="http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk/GoasmHelp/usstack2.htm">
