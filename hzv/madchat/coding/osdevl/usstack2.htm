<font face="Century Gothic"><a name="virtual"></a>
</font></p><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Stack is in virtual address space</font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">The value in ESP is a <i>virtual address</i>.  If it is for example, a value
of 64FE3Ch at start up, we are not talking here of this address in real
physical memory.  To obtain the actual physical memory address the system 
needs to convert (or "map") the 64FE3Ch according to its own internal records.
For example this address might in reality be 2FE3Ch in real physical memory.
A virtual address is therefore just a convenient representation of a 
position in memory.  It is often said that each application runs in its 
own virtual address space.  In theory the whole range of
32-bit addresses (zero to 4GB) is available to each application.  In practice
this is not the case, but it is true that each application running on the
system may use the same range of virtual addresses.  There is no conflict
between them because the system knows which application is addressing
memory at any one time and can therefore point the application to the correct
place in physical memory.  So at any one time it is likely that there
are several applications with the same value in ESP.  But this value will
actually point to different parts of physical memory.

<a name="startc"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">The stack at start-up: contents<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack2_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">In Windows the main thread is allocated its own stack area by the system
when it loads.  The system itself uses this thread and the stack area for 
its own purposes prior to calling the program's starting address. You can 
see this in the debugger.  Start your program up to the starting address 
and look at the value of ESP.  Now open an inspector window for
the value of ESP.  Now you might expect it to be at the bottom of the
memory area, but it is not. If you scroll the inspector to the bottom of the 
memory area (scroll to the highest address) you see that there has
already been a lot of activity in the stack where the system has prepared
for its call to the program's starting address.  Of interest is that 
(in W98 anyway) the last value on the stack before the application was 
called is a return address in Kernel32.dll.  This indicates that a function
within Kernel32.dll called the application.  Because of this return address
it is possible to use a simple RET to end a process, rather than calling
ExitProcess.  Of course this only works if the stack is in equilibrium so
that code execution continues in the caller function in Kernel32.dll.
<br>
A little further down
the stack we can see the filename of the application, and much further
down we can see the address of the of the system's own exception handler for the
application's main thread has been put on the stack.  These things all show that
the application's own stack area (and own thread) is used by the system to 
prepare for a call to the application.

<a name="starta"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">The stack at start-up: amount<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack2_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">In Windows, when memory is reserved for the use of an application
a range of virtual addresses is <i>allocated</i> by the system.  This
allocation preserves those addresses for the application's use.  If the 
application asks for more memory the same addresses cannot be reused.
No physical memory is actually used until the memory is <i>committed</i>.
At that point the virtual addresses which have been allocated are mapped
to the area or areas of physical memory the system has available.
<br>Obviously for this arrangement to work, the system needs to know
the maximum size of contiguous memory which may have to be committed.
This is then the allocated range of addresses.  
<br>When preserving memory for stack use the same applies.  On an 
application's start-up the system needs to know how much memory to allocate
for the stack, and how much to commit in the first instance.  These two
amounts are contained within the executable at +48h and +4Ch respectively
in the optional header (to understand exactly where this is in the
executable, you need to know the PE file format).  As we see below they 
apply not only to the application's
main thread but also to new threads made by the application.  
<br>Most linkers use a default of 1MB and 4K (the normal page size) for 
these values respectively.
With GoLink you can alter the defaults using the <b>/stacksize</b> switch and
<b>/stackinit</b> switches respectively (see the GoLink manual how to
use these).

<a name="enlarge"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Enlargement of the stack at run-time<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack2_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">The system senses whether an application is attempting to read or write 
outside the committed stack area by using exception handling.  Providing 
(in W9x) the attempt is within the permitted usable stack area new memory 
will be committed as required.  Even if an attempt is made to enlarge the
stack beyond the allocated area, under NT (but not W9x) the system will 
try to allocate further memory, but this will not be possible if the 
virtual addresses then required have been allocated to other memory areas.

<a name="usable"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Permitted usable stack area<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack2_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">The stack is not considered suitable for keeping large amounts of data
and this view is enforced by Windows by its exception mechanism.  In W9x
the permitted usable stack area is between the current ESP and the next 
page boundary plus the page size.  For example if ESP is 64FE3Ch, then
the next page boundary is 64F000h and the extra page (which is usually
set at 4K by the system) takes you to 64E000h:-

</tbody></table>
</font><p><font face="Century Gothic">So if ESP is 64FE3Ch you will find that the instruction
</font></p><pre><font face="Century Gothic">MOV D[ESP-1E40h],0
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">will cause an exception, because the actual point on the stack being 
addressed here is 64DFFCh which area is unavailable because it has not
been committed by the system.
<br>And you can't get round this by moving ESP either.  In W9x the system 
allows you to move ESP only up to the next page boundary + the page size
less four bytes.  For example if ESP is 64FE3C a single instruction will 
only be permitted to move ESP by 1E38h (in decimal this is 7836 bytes).
This means that the instruction
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">SUB ESP,1E38h 
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">causes ESP to become 64E004h and is permitted. But the instruction
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">SUB ESP,1E3Ch
</font></pre><font face="Century Gothic"> 
will cause an exception.  The difference in 4 bytes in the position
which triggers the exception suggests that there are two different
protection mechanisms at work here.
</font><p><font face="Century Gothic">From the above it might appear that the size of data which might be put on the stack 
is limited to 4K, but this is not true.  There are two ways to avoid these 
exceptions from occurring and thereby to use the stack for larger data areas. 
<br>The first way is to move and use ESP <i>incrementally</i>.  This will 
ensure that the system commits the memory progressively as intended.  The
following code safely creates an area of 40K bytes on the stack:-
</font></p><pre><font face="Century Gothic">MOV ECX,10
L0:
SUB ESP,1000h
MOV D[ESP],0
LOOP L0
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">Here the system is made to commit ten 4K chunks of stack memory.  ESP
then ends up at the top of this stack area. This will not be particularly
quick since the system has to commit memory ten times.  A quicker method
is to instruct the system to commit a larger than usual area of memory 
for the stack when the application is loaded.  With GoLink you can do
this using the /stackinit switch.  For example:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">/stackinit 0A000
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">will ensure that 40K of memory is committed on the stack at start-up.
You will then be able safely to move ESP using the instruction:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">SUB ESP,0A000h
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">giving you 40K of memory on the stack to play with.

<a name="datas"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Using the stack to keep data streams<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack2_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">Provided precautions are taken, the stack can be used to hold
a fairly large stream of data.  The things to remember are:-
</font><ul>
<li><font face="Century Gothic">Always restore ESP to equilibrium when you have finished with the stack.
</font></li><li><font face="Century Gothic">Never write to [ESP] unless you have subtracted at least 4 bytes from
the original value of ESP because that holds the return address for the 
procedure.  Never write to [ESP+n] unless a sufficient number of bytes
have been subtracted from ESP to avoid overwriting other important data.
</font></li><li><font face="Century Gothic">If you do not move ESP to the top of the data area then you need
to write the data <i>in reverse direction</i> that is to say into progressively
decreasing values.  This can be done in various ways, the most convenient
is probably to set the direction flag using STD and then to use the
MOVS instruction, for example:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">MOV ECX,8000
MOV EDI,ESP
SUB EDI,4
STD                     ;set direction flag
REP MOVSD               ;move ECX dwords from [ESI] to [EDI]
CLD                     ;clear direction flag
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">This code writes 8,000 dwords to the stack.  Note how SUB EDI,4 avoids the 
write over [ESP] which holds the return address for the procedure.  There
is no problem with enlargement of memory since the write is incremental, so
the system properly creates new 4K memory areas as it needs to.
</font></li><li><font face="Century Gothic">If you do move ESP to the top of the data area you must take the 
precautions referred to in <a href="#usable">permitted usable stack area</a>.
Having done this you can write to the stack in a <i>forward</i> direction.
</font></li></ul>

<font face="Century Gothic"><a name="multi"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">The stack in multi-thread applications<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack2_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">Each thread in your application has its own registers and its own stack.
That is to say, when the system gives processor-time to a thread, it will
switch to the <i>register context</i> for the thread.  This holds all the 
values of the registers when processor-time was last removed from the 
thread.  Since the registers include ESP, its value will also be
correctly switched so that the correct area of physical memory will be used 
by the thread as its stack.  The result is that a thread can rely on the fact
that it can use its stack as a discrete area of memory which will not be
interfered with by other threads.  You can see this in the debugger.  You can
see that the ESP always changes substantially when execution changes
from thread to thread.
</font><p><font face="Century Gothic">When a thread starts it is allocated its stack
area.  As a practical example, it was found under W98 that the stack of
the main thread of an application ran from 64FE3Ch (downwards) and when a 
new thread was made its stack ran from 75FF9Ch (downwards).  In another
test, when six new threads were made their stacks started at 19DEF9Ch,
1AFFF9Ch, 1C1FF9Ch, 1D3FF9Ch, 1E5FF9Ch and 1F7FF9Ch respectively.  Here
you can see that the system is separating the virtual address of each 
stack area by 128KB more than the default 1MB area.  This is probably to allow
room for the system's own use of the stack and also some extra leeway.
Changing the allocation stack size to 200000h (2MB) using the /stacksize 
switch and then creating six new threads resulted in the stack areas 
being separated by 128KB more than 2MB.

<a name="local"></a></font></p><h3><font face="Century Gothic">The stack frame and local data<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack2_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">A stack frame is a discrete area of the stack which holds a return
address of a function and data used by that function without risk of
overwrite because the value of ESP has been decreased.  The data kept in a stack
frame is called "local data".  That's because it is intended only for
use within the stack frame concerned and is not intended to be addressed
by the program generally.  Lets take this simple example:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">PROCEDURE1:
SUB ESP,20h                ;make space on stack for local data
;                          ;use local data area
CALL PROCEDURE2
;                          ;return from PROCEDURE2
;                          ;continue to use local data
ADD ESP,20h                ;restore ESP to equilibrium
RET
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">and
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">PROCEDURE2:
PUSH EAX,EBX,ECX
;                          ;carry out various calculations
POP ECX,EBX,EAX
RET
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">Here the stack frame is created using the SUB ESP,20h instruction.  This
decreases the value of ESP by 32 bytes creating space on the stack for 8
dwords.  Now because ESP has been moved, whatever happens in PROCEDURE2
will not overwrite these 8 dwords.  Lets check this visually assuming
that ESP is 64FE38h at the start of PROCEDURE1:-

<font face="Century Gothic"><a name="addressl"></a></font></p><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Addressing the local data<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack2_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic"><i>Note: this is automated in GoAsm using FRAME..ENDF and in MASM using 
PROC..ENDP</i>.
<br>Since ESP points to the top of the local data area you can address the data 
using ESP.  So in the example above the first
dword of local data would be available at [ESP] immediately after the
SUB ESP,20h.  But using ESP to keep track of the local data on the stack can be 
difficult because ESP will move on each CALL or PUSH within the procedure.
For this reason the EBP register tends to be used for this purpose instead.  
This is usually set early in the stack frame to the <i>bottom</i> of the 
local data and it will not be changed until execution leaves the stack
frame.  In this way you can be confident that the local data can always
be addressed using a particular offset from EBP.
<br>So the code for a typical stack frame now looks like this:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">TypicalStackFrame:
PUSH EBP          ;save the value of ebp which will be altered    }
MOV EBP,ESP       ;give current value of stack pointer to ebp     } "prologue"
SUB ESP,0Ch       ;make space for local data                      }
;                 ;POINT "X"
;
;                 ;code within the procedure
;
MOV ESP,EBP       ;restore the stack pointer to previous value    }
POP EBP           ;restore the value of ebp                       } "epilogue"
RET               ;return to caller adjusting the stack pointer   }
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">Here we have moved the stack pointer by 12 bytes.  At point "X" the stack
by reference to EBP actually looks like this:- 
</font><p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#ffffff">

</tbody></table>
<font face="Century Gothic"><br>Now throughout the stack frame, whatever happens to ESP the local 
data will always be accessible at [EBP-4h], [EBP-8h] and [EBP-0Ch].
<br>Note how ESP is restored to equilibrium automatically by the use of
MOV ESP,EBP just before returning to the caller.  
<br>You don't have to use EBP for this purpose, any register will do. But
EBP is traditionally used for this and your code will be more understandable
to others if you stick to this.

<a name="params"></a></font></p><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Accessing parameters from the stack<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack2_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">We have already seen how to pass parameters on the stack to other procedures.
Now we are going to see how to use parameters passed to procedures in
your own code.  Basically these parameters are further down the stack so
they will not be overwritten under any normal circumstances.  For this 
reason it is not necessary to
retrieve and save them at all.  Upon entry to a procedure ESP will point
to the return address of the procedure (inserted by CALL).  So the parameters
will be at [ESP+4h], [ESP+8h], [ESP+0Ch] and so on, depending on how many
parameters there are.  But it may be difficult to keep track of exactly
where the parameters are using ESP because it will change upon the next
PUSH or CALL.  So again you can use EBP to point to the parameters.
<br>If you have the prologue code:-
</font><pre><font face="Century Gothic">PUSH EBP          ;save the value of ebp which will be altered    }
MOV EBP,ESP       ;give current value of stack pointer to ebp     } "prologue"
SUB ESP,0Ch       ;make space for local data                      }
</font></pre>
<font face="Century Gothic">When ESP is given to EBP it is 4 bytes less in value than at the beginning of the 
call (this is because of the first "PUSH EBP").  Therefore the parameters 
can now be accessed using [EBP+8h], [EBP+0Ch], 
[EBP+10h] and so on, depending on how many parameters there are.

<a name="callbacks"></a></font><h3><font face="Century Gothic">Use of the stack in Window's callback procedures<a href="#contents"><img src=".usstack2_files/up.gif" border="0" height="12" width="24">contents</a></font></h3>
<font face="Century Gothic">The two techniques just dealt with (making space for local data and 
addressing parameters) are required in Windows callback procedures.
The callback procedure most frequently found in Windows programs is the
window procedure.  It is to this procedure that Windows sends "messages" 
and Windows expects the correct reply.  What is happening here is that
Windows <i>calls</i> the windows procedure using the program's own thread.
This usually happens while the program is in the message loop either waiting 
for a return from the API GetMessage, or whilst executing the API 
DispatchMessage.
<br>Luckily in GoAsm you can use FRAME..ENDF to retrieve the parameters
sent by windows and to address them by name.  You can also easily
make local data areas addressable by name.  And you can preserve registers
and also restore the stack to equilibrium automatically too.  See
the <a href="http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk/GoasmHelp/GoAsm.htm#frame">GoAsm manual</a> for a full description of 
how to do this or go back to <a href="http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk/GoasmHelp/usstack1.htm">understanding the
stack (part 1)</a>.
