<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Network Programming with Perl</b></font></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Using Perl to make network tasks
easy--here's how.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">by James Lee</font></i>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perl has been called the glue that holds the
Internet together because it is an extremely powerful text processing and CGI
programming language. Although Perl was designed in the beginning to be a text
manipulation language, it has evolved into a potent multi-purpose programming
language. One area in which Perl has shown its power is that of network
programming.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perl makes network programming easy by
providing built-in functions that can be used to create low-level client/server
programs from scratch. Also, many modules are freely available that make
programming common networking tasks simple and quick. These tasks include
pinging remote machines, TELNET and FTP sessions. This article presents examples
of each of these types of network programs.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Client/server network programming requires a
server running on one machine to serve one or more clients running on either the
same machine or different machines. These different machines can be located
anywhere on the network.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To create a server, simply perform the
following steps using the built-in Perl function indicated :</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Create a socket with <b>socket</b>.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bind the socket to a port address with <b>bind</b>.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Listen to the socket at the port address
    with <b>listen</b>.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Accept client connections with <b>accept</b>.</font>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Establishing a client is even easier:</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Create a socket with <b>socket</b>.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Connect (the socket) to the remote machine
    with <b>connect</b>.</font>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Several other required functions and variables
are defined in the <b>Socket.pm</b> module. This module is probably already
installed on your machine, but if not, it is available at the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network (CPAN), the official Perl source code repository (see Resources).
To use this module in our programs, the following statement is required at the
top of the program:</font>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">use Socket;</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Viewing Module Documentation</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All examples in this article use modules that
are available at no cost from CPAN.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perl modules are usually self-documenting. If
the author of the module follows the generally accepted rules of creating a Perl
module, they will add Plain Old Documentation (POD) to the module's .pm file.
One way to view the POD for the Socket module (assuming Perl and Socket.pm were
installed correctly) is to execute the following at the shell :</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">perldoc Socket</font></p>
This command displays Socket.pm's POD converted to a man page. The output is a
relatively thorough discussion of the functions and variables defined in this
module.
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Another way to view the documentation is to
convert the POD to text using:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">pod2text \<br>
/usr/lib/perl5/i686-linux/5.00404/Socket.pm | more</font></p>
The program pod2textis included in the Perl distribution, as are the programs
pod2html, pod2man, pod2usageand pod2latex.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>A Simple Server</b></font></p>
<p><a href="../standby/3237l1.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 1.</font></a>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our first programming example is a simple
server running on one machine that can service only one client program at a time
connecting from the same or a different machine. Recall that the steps for
creating a server were to create a socket, bind it to a port, listen at the port
and accept client connections.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 1, server1.pl, is the source code for
this simple server. First, it is generally a good idea to compile using Perl's
strict rules :</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">use strict;</font></p>
This requires all variables to be declared with the myfunction before they are
used. Using my may be inconvenient, but it can catch many common syntactically
correct yet logically incorrect programming bugs.<b></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The variable <tt>$port</tt> is assigned the
first command-line argument or port 7890 as the default. When choosing a port
for your server, pick one that is unused on your machine. Note that the only way
to ensure you select a port that does not have a predefined use is to look at
the appropriate RFC (see Resources).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Next, the socket is created using the socket
function. A socket is like a file handle--it can be read from, written to or
both. The function <b>setsockopt</b> is called to ensure that the port will be
immediately reusable.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The <b>sockaddr_in</b> function obtains a port
on the server. The argument <tt>INADDR_ANY</tt> chooses one of the server's
virtual IP addresses. You could instead decide to bind only one of the virtual
IP addresses by replacing <tt>INADDR_ANY</tt> with</font>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">inet_aton(&quot;192.168.1.1&quot;)</font></p>
or
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">gethostbyname(&quot;server.onsight.com&quot;)</font></p>
The bind function binds the socket to the port, i.e., plugs the socket into that
port. Then, the listen function causes the server to begin listening at the
port. The second argument to the listen function is the maximum queue length or
the maximum number of pending client connections. The value SOMAXCONNis the
maximum queue length for the machine being used.<tt></tt>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Once the server begins listening at the port,
it can accept client connections using the accept function. When the client is
accepted, a new socket is created named <tt>CLIENT</tt> which can be used like a
file handle. Reading from the socket reads the client's output and printing to
the socket sends data to the client.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To read from a file handle or socket in Perl,
wrap it in angle brackets (&lt;<i>FH</i>&gt;). To write to it, use the <b>print</b>
function :</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">print SOCKET;</font></p>
The return value of the accept function is the Internet address of the client in
a packed format. The function sockaddr_in takes that format and returns the
client's port number and the client's numeric Internet address in a packed
format. The packed numeric Internet address can be converted to a text string
representing the numeric IP using inet_ntoa(numeric to ASCII). To convert the
packed numeric address to a host name, the function gethostbyaddris used.<b></b><b></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let's assume all of the servers referred to in
this article are started on the machine named server.onsight.com. To start the
server on this machine, execute :</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">[james@server networking]$ server1.pl<br>
SERVER started on port 7890</font></p>
The server is now listening at port 7890 on server.onsight.com, waiting for
clients to connect.
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>A Simple Client</b></font></p>
<p><a href="../standby/3237l2.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 2.</font></a>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 2, client1.pl, shows a simple client.
The first command-line argument to this program is the host name to which it
should connect, which defaults to server.onsight.com. The second command-line
argument is the port number which defaults to 7890.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The host name and the port number are used to
generate the port address using <b>inet_aton</b> (ASCII to numeric) and
sockaddr_in. A socket is then created using socket and the client connects the
socket to the port address using connect.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The <tt>while</tt> loop then reads the data the
server sends to the client until the end-of-file is reached, printing this input
to STDOUT. Then the socket is closed.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let's assume all of the clients are started on
the the machine named client.avue.com, although they could be executed from any
machine on the network. To execute the client, type :</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">[james@client networking]$ client1.pl
server.onsight.com<br>
Hello from the server: Tue Oct 27 09:48:40 1998</font></p>
The following is the standard output from the server:
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">got a connection from: client.avue.com
[192.168.1.2]</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Perl Makes Life Easy</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Creating sockets using the functions described
above is good when you want to control how the socket is created, the protocol
to be used, etc. But using the functions above is too hard; I prefer the easy
way--<b>IO::Socket</b>.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The module IO::Socket provides an easy way to
create sockets which can then be used like file handles. If you don't have it
installed on your machine, it can be found on CPAN. To see this module's POD,
type :</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">perldoc IO::Socket</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A Simple Server Using IO::Socket</font></b></p>
<p><a href="../standby/3237l3.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 3.</font></a>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 3, serverIO.pl, is a simple server
using IO::Socket. A new <tt>IO::Socket::INET</tt> object is created using the <b>new</b>
method. Note that the arguments to the method include the host name, port number,
protocol, queue length and an option indicating we want this port to be
immediately reusable. The new method returns a socket that is assigned to <tt>$sock</tt>.
This socket can be used like a file handle--we can either read the client output
from it, or write to it by sending data to the client.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A client connection is accepted using the
accept method. Note the accept method returns the client socket when evaluated
in scalar context :</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">$new_sock = $sock-&gt;accept()<br>
($new_sock, $client_addr) = $sock-&gt;accept()</font></p>
The client address is computed and printed the same as in Listing 1, server1.pl.
Then the socket associated with that client is read until end-of-file. The data
read is printed to STDOUT. This example illustrates that the server can read
from a client using &lt;&gt; around the socket variable.
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>A Simple Client Using IO::Socket</b></font></p>
<p><a href="../standby/3237l4.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 4.</font></a>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 4, clientIO.pl, is a simple client
using <tt>IO::Socket</tt>. This time, a new object is created that connects to a
host at a port using the TCP protocol. Ten strings are then printed to that
server, then the socket is closed.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If the server in Listing 3, serverIO.pl, is
executed and then the client Listing 4, clientIO.pl, connects, the output would
be :</font>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">[james@server networking]$ serverIO.pl</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">got a connection from: client.avue.com

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Bidirectional Communication</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is possible to create servers and clients
that communicate with one another in both directions. For instance, the client
may send information to the server, then the server may send information back to
the client. Therefore, network programs can be written so that the server and
client follow some predetermined protocol.</font>
<p><a href="../standby/3237l5.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 5.</font></a>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 5, server2way.pl, shows how a simple
server can be created to read a command from a client, then print out an
appropriate response to the client. The module <b>Sys::Hostname</b> provides a
function named <b>hostname</b> that returns the host name of the server. To
insure output is seen as we print, IO buffering is turned off for the STDOUT
file handle using the <b>autoflush</b> function. Then a <tt>while</tt> loop is
executed that accepts connections. When a client connects, the server reads a
line from the client, chopping off the newline character. Then a <tt>switch</tt>
statement is executed. (The <tt>switch</tt> is cleverly disguised as a <tt>foreach</tt>
loop, which happens to be one of my favorite ways of writing a <tt>switch</tt>.)
Depending on the input entered by the client, the server outputs an appropriate
response. All lines from the client are read until end-of-file.</font>
<p><a href="../standby/3237l6.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 6.</font></a>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 6, client2way.pl, shows the companion
client. A connection to the server is made, then the client prints a few
commands to the server reads the response and prints the response to <tt>STDOUT</tt>.</font>

in Listing 6 :</font>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>A Forking Client</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you want to write a client that accepts
commands from STDIN and sends them to the server, the easiest solution is to
write a client that forks a child. (A solution can be written using <b>select</b>
that does not fork, but it is more complicated.) The client's parent process
will read the commands from the user through STDIN and print them to the server.
The client's child process will then read from the server and print the
responses to STDOUT.</font>
<p><a href="../standby/3237l7.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 7.</font></a>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 7, clientfork.pl, is an example of a
client that forks.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To fork in Perl, call the cleverly named <b>fork</b>
function. It returns <tt>undef</tt> if the fork fails. If it succeeds, it
returns <tt>0</tt> to the child, non-zero (the child's pid) to the parent. In
clientfork.pl, an <tt>if</tt> statement checks the value of <tt>$kid</tt>, the
return value from the fork. If <tt>$kid</tt> is true (non-zero, the child's pid),
parent executes reading from STDIN printing to the server. If <tt>$kid</tt> is
false (zero), the child executes reading from the server printing to STDOUT.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The following is the example session executing
the client code in Listing 7, clientfork.pl connecting to the code in Listing 5,

When the parent process is finished reading from STDIN, it executes the
killfunction to kill the child process. It is very important the parent reap its
child so that the child does not outlive the parent and become a zombie.<b></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>A Forking Server</b></font></p>
<p><a href="../standby/3237l8.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 8.</font></a>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Servers usually don't handle only one client at
a time. One approach to a server that can handle more than one client is a
server that forks a child process to handle each client connection. Listing 8,
serverfork.pl, is an example of a forking server.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One way for the parent process to reap its
children is to define a subroutine and assign a reference to that subroutine to <tt>$SIG{CHLD}</tt>.
(The hash <tt>%SIG</tt> is Perl's way of handling signals.) In this example, a
subroutine named <b>REAP</b> is defined and a reference to this subroutine is
assigned to <tt>$SIG{CHLD}</tt>. When the parent receives the <tt>CHLD</tt> (child
terminated) signal, the REAP subroutine will be invoked.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Within the <tt>while</tt> loop that accepts all
the client connections, the server forks. If the fork returns true, the parent
is running and it executes the <tt>next</tt> statement which immediately
transfers control to the <tt>continue</tt> block, performs the housecleaning
step of closing the child socket and waits for the next client to connect. If
the fork returns <tt>undef</tt>, then the fork failed, so the server dies. If
the fork returns neither true nor <tt>undef</tt>, then the child is running, so
the parent socket is closed and the child reads from the client and processes
the client. When the child is finished processing the client, the child exits
and is reaped by the parent.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Thread Programming in Perl5.005</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Perl version 5.005 supports thread programming.
This means a threaded networking program can be created to be either a server or
a client.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listings 9, 10, and 11 are three different
versions of a client that logs into several web servers and determines the type
of server being used (Apache, Netscape, etc).</font>
<p><a href="../standby/3237l9.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 9.</font></a>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listing 9, getservertype1.pl, shows a
non-forking, non-threaded client. First, an array of hosts is created and
initialized to a few web sites. The subroutine <b>doit</b> is defined to receive
the web server name as an argument, open a client connection to that server at
port 80 (the HTTP port), send the HTTP request and read each line of response.
When the line starting <tt>Server:</tt> is read, it will extract the server name
and store it in <tt>$1</tt>. Then the host name and web server name are printed.
This subroutine is called for each host in the array of hosts.</font>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The <b>Net::FTP</b> module makes automating FTP
sessions easy. Listing 14, ftp.pl, is an example of connecting and getting a
file.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A <tt>Net::FTP</tt> object is created, the
login is called to log in to the machine, the <b>cwd</b> changes the working
directory and the <b>get</b> method gets the file. Then the session is
terminated with <b>quit</b>.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are methods to do many common FTP
operations: <b>put</b>, <b>binary</b>, <b>rename</b>, <b>delete</b>, etc. To see
a list of all the available methods, type :</font>

<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Archive a Web Site</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Using both Net::Telnet and Net::FTP, a very
simple script can be created that can archive a directory structure on a remote
machine.</font>
<p><a href="../standby/3237l15.html"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Listing 15.</font></a>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Listing 15, taritup.pl, is a Perl program that
is similar to a program I use that logs in to my ISP and archives my web site.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The steps this program follows are :</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Start a session on the remote machine with
    TELNET.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Go to the web page directory using <b>cd</b>.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Archive the directory using <b>tar</b>.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Start an FTP session to the remote machine.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Change to the directory containing the tar
    file.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Get the tar file.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Quit the FTP session.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Back in the TELNET session, delete the tar
    file on the remote machine.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Close the TELNET session.</font>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This program outputs text to let the user know
how the script is progressing.</font>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Summary</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perl is a powerful, easy-to-use programming
language. That power and ease of use includes network programming due to many
built-in functions and modules. Best of all, it's free.</font>
