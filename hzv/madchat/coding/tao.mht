<H2 align=3Dright><A name=3Dbook1>Book 1 - The Silent Void </A></H2>
<P>Thus spake the master programmer:=20
<P>``When you have learned to snatch the error code from the trap frame, =
it will=20
be time for you to leave.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>1.1</H3>
<P>Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. Waiting =
alone and=20
unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is the =
source of=20
all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it the Tao of =
Programming.=20
<P>If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great. If the =
operating=20
system is great, then the compiler is great. If the compiler is great, =
then the=20
application is great. The user is pleased and there exists harmony in =
the world.=20

<P>The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of =
morning.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>1.2</H3>
<P>The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth =
to the=20
assembler.=20
<P>The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now there are ten thousand=20
languages.=20
<P>Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language =
expresses the=20
Yin and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the Tao.=20
<P>But do not program in <TT>COBOL</TT> if you can avoid it.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>1.3</H3>
<P>In the beginning was the Tao. The Tao gave birth to Space and Time. =
Therefore=20
Space and Time are Yin and Yang of programming.=20
<P>Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out of =
time and=20
space for their programs. Programmers that comprehend the Tao always =
have enough=20
time and space to accomplish their goals.=20
<P>How could it be otherwise?=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>1.4</H3>
<P>The wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it. The average =
programmer=20
is told about Tao and searches for it. The foolish programmer is told =
about Tao=20
and laughs at it.=20
<P>If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao.=20
<P>The highest sounds are hardest to hear. <BR>Going forward is a way to =

retreat. <BR>Great talent shows itself late in life. <BR>Even a perfect =
program=20
still has bugs. <BR>
<HR>

<H2 align=3Dright><A name=3Dbook2>Book 2 - The Ancient Masters</A></H2>
<P>Thus spake the master programmer:=20
<P>``After three days without programming, life becomes meaningless.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>2.1</H3>
<P>The programmers of old were mysterious and profound. We cannot fathom =
their=20
thoughts, so all we do is describe their appearance.=20
<P>Aware, like a fox crossing the water. Alert, like a general on the=20
battlefield. Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests. Simple, like =
uncarved=20
blocks of wood. Opaque, like black pools in darkened caves.=20
<P>Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds?=20
<P>The answer exists only in Tao.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>2.2</H3>
<P>Grand Master Turing once dreamed that he was a machine. When he awoke =
he=20
exclaimed:=20
<BLOCKQUOTE>``I don't know whether I am Turing dreaming that I am a =
machine,=20
  or a machine dreaming that I am Turing!'' </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3 align=3Dcenter>2.3</H3>
<P>A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software =
conference=20
and then returned to report to his manager, saying: ``What sort of =
programmers=20
work for other companies? They behaved badly and were unconcerned with=20
appearances. Their hair was long and unkempt and their clothes were =
wrinkled and=20
old. They crashed our hospitality suite and they made rude noises during =
my=20
presentation.''=20
<P>The manager said: ``I should have never sent you to the conference. =
Those=20
programmers live beyond the physical world. They consider life absurd, =
an=20
accidental coincidence. They come and go without knowing limitations. =
Without a=20
care, they live only for their programs. Why should they bother with =
social=20
conventions?=20
<P>``They are alive within the Tao.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>2.4</H3>
<P>A novice asked the Master: ``Here is a programmer that never designs, =

documents or tests his programs. Yet all who know him consider him one =
of the=20
best programmers in the world. Why is this?''=20
<P>The Master replies: ``That programmer has mastered the Tao. He has =
gone=20
beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the system =
crashes,=20
but accepts the universe without concern. He has gone beyond the need =
for=20
documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code. He has =
gone=20
beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect within =
themselves,=20
serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident. Truly, he has entered =
the=20
mystery of Tao.''=20
<HR>

<H2 align=3Dright><A name=3Dbook3>Book 3 - Design</A></H2>
<P>Thus spake the master programmer:=20
<P>``When the program is being tested, it is too late to make design =
changes.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>3.1</H3>
<P>There once was a man who went to a computer trade show. Each day as =
he=20
entered, the man told the guard at the door:=20
<BLOCKQUOTE>``I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting. =
Be=20
  forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered.'' =
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions =
of=20
dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man carefully. =
But the=20
man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming quietly to himself.=20
<P>When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes, =
but=20
nothing was to be found.=20
<P>On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the =
guard=20
saying: ``I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be even=20
better.'' So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail.=20
<P>On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his =
curiosity no=20
longer. ``Sir Thief,'' he said, ``I am so perplexed, I cannot live in =
peace.=20
Please enlighten me. What is it that you are stealing?''=20
<P>The man smiled. ``I am stealing ideas,'' he said.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>3.2</H3>
<P>There once was a master programmer who wrote unstructured programs. A =
novice=20
programmer, seeking to imitate him, also began to write unstructured =
programs.=20
When the novice asked the master to evaluate his progress, the master =
criticized=20
him for writing unstructured programs, saying, ``What is appropriate for =
the=20
master is not appropriate for the novice. You must understand the Tao =
before=20
transcending structure.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>3.3</H3>
<P>There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the =
warlord of=20
Wu. The warlord asked the programmer: ``Which is easier to design: an =
accounting=20
package or an operating system?''=20
<P>``An operating system,'' replied the programmer.=20
<P>The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief. ``Surely an =
accounting=20
package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating system,'' he =
said.=20
<P>``Not so,'' said the programmer, ``when designing an accounting =
package, the=20
programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas: =
how it=20
must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to =
the tax=20
laws. By contrast, an operating system is not limited by outside =
appearances.=20
When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the simplest =
harmony=20
between machine and ideas. This is why an operating system is easier to=20
design.''=20
<P>The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled. ``That is all good and well, but =
which=20
is easier to debug?''=20
<P>The programmer made no reply.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>3.4</H3>
<P>A manager went to the master programmer and showed him the =
requirements=20
document for a new application. The manager asked the master: ``How long =
will it=20
take to design this system if I assign five programmers to it?''=20
<P>``It will take one year,'' said the master promptly.=20
<P>``But we need this system immediately or even sooner! How long will =
it take=20
if I assign ten programmers to it?''=20
<P>The master programmer frowned. ``In that case, it will take two =
years.''=20
<P>``And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it?''=20
<P>The master programmer shrugged. ``Then the design will never be =
completed,''=20
he said.=20
<HR>

<H2 align=3Dright><A name=3Dbook4>Book 4 - Coding</A></H2>
<P>Thus spake the master programmer:=20
<P>``A well-written program is its own heaven; a poorly-written program =
is its=20
own hell.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>4.1</H3>
<P>A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a =
string=20
of pearls. The spirit and intent of the program should be retained =
throughout.=20
There should be neither too little or too much, neither needless loops =
nor=20
useless variables, neither lack of structure nor overwhelming rigidity.=20
<P>A program should follow the `Law of Least Astonishment'. What is this =
law? It=20
is simply that the program should always respond to the user in the way =
that=20
astonishes him least.=20
<P>A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit. The =
program=20
should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward =
appearances.=20
<P>If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of =
disorder=20
and confusion. The only way to correct this is to rewrite the program.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>4.2</H3>
<P>A novice asked the master: ``I have a program that sometime runs and=20
sometimes aborts. I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am =
totally=20
baffled. What is the reason for this?''=20
<P>The master replied: ``You are confused because you do not understand =
Tao.=20
Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans. Why do you =
expect=20
it from a machine that humans have constructed? Computers simulate =
determinism;=20
only Tao is perfect.=20
<P>``The rules of programming are transitory; only Tao is eternal. =
Therefore you=20
must contemplate Tao before you receive enlightenment.''=20
<P>``But how will I know when I have received enlightenment?'' asked the =
novice.=20

<P>``Your program will then run correctly,'' replied the master.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>4.3</H3>
<P>A master was explaining the nature of Tao of to one of his novices. =
``The Tao=20
is embodied in all software - regardless of how insignificant,'' said =
the=20
master.=20
<P>``Is the Tao in a hand-held calculator?'' asked the novice.=20
<P>``It is,'' came the reply.=20
<P>``Is the Tao in a video game?'' continued the novice.=20
<P>``It is even in a video game,'' said the master.=20
<P>``And is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer?''=20
<P>The master coughed and shifted his position slightly. ``The lesson is =
over=20
for today,'' he said.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>4.4</H3>
<P>Prince Wang's programmer was coding software. His fingers danced upon =
the=20
keyboard. The program compiled without an error message, and the program =
ran=20
like a gentle wind.=20
<P>``Excellent!'' the Prince exclaimed, ``Your technique is faultless!'' =

<P>``Technique?'' said the programmer turning from his terminal, ``What =
I follow=20
is Tao - beyond all techniques! When I first began to program I would =
see before=20
me the whole problem in one mass. After three years I no longer saw this =
mass.=20
Instead, I used subroutines. But now I see nothing. My whole being =
exists in a=20
formless void. My senses are idle. My spirit, free to work without plan, =
follows=20
its own instinct. In short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes =
there are=20
difficult problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch silently. =
Then I=20
change a single line of code and the difficulties vanish like puffs of =
idle=20
smoke. I then compile the program. I sit still and let the joy of the =
work fill=20
my being. I close my eyes for a moment and then log off.''=20
<P>Prince Wang said, ``Would that all of my programmers were as wise!''=20
<HR>

<H2 align=3Dright><A name=3Dbook5>Book 5 - Maintenance</A></H2>
<P>Thus spake the master programmer:=20
<P>``Though a program be but three lines long, someday it will have to =
be=20
maintained.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>5.1</H3>
<P>A well-used door needs no oil on its hinges. <BR>A swift-flowing =
stream does=20
not grow stagnant. <BR>Neither sound nor thoughts can travel through a =
vacuum.=20
<BR>Software rots if not used. <BR>
<P>These are great mysteries.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>5.2</H3>
<P>A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish the =
program=20
on which he was working. ``It will be finished tomorrow,'' the =
programmer=20
promptly replied.=20
<P>``I think you are being unrealistic,'' said the manager, =
``Truthfully, how=20
long will it take?''=20
<P>The programmer thought for a moment. ``I have some features that I =
wish to=20
add. This will take at least two weeks,'' he finally said.=20
<P>``Even that is too much to expect,'' insisted the manager, ``I will =
be=20
satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete.''=20
<P>The programmer agreed to this.=20
<P>Several years later, the manager retired. On the way to his =
retirement=20
luncheon, he discovered the programmer asleep at his terminal. He had =
been=20
programming all night.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>5.3</H3>
<P>A novice programmer was once assigned to code a simple financial =
package.=20
<P>The novice worked furiously for many days, but when his master =
reviewed his=20
program, he discovered that it contained a screen editor, a set of =
generalized=20
graphics routines, an artificial intelligence interface, but not the =
slightest=20
mention of anything financial.=20
<P>When the master asked about this, the novice became indignant. =
``Don't be so=20
impatient,'' he said, ``I'll put in the financial stuff eventually.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>5.4</H3>
<P>Does a good farmer neglect a crop he has planted? <BR>Does a good =
teacher=20
overlook even the most humble student? <BR>Does a good father allow a =
single=20
child to starve? <BR>Does a good programmer refuse to maintain his code? =
<BR>
<HR>

<H2 align=3Dright><A name=3Dbook6>Book 6 - Management</A></H2>
<P>Thus spake the master programmer:=20
<P>``Let the programmers be many and the managers few - then all will be =

productive.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>6.1</H3>
<P>When managers hold endless meetings, the programmers write games. =
When=20
accountants talk of quarterly profits, the development budget is about =
to be=20
cut. When senior scientists talk blue sky, the clouds are about to roll =
in.=20
<P>Truly, this is not the Tao of Programming.=20
<P>When managers make commitments, game programs are ignored. When =
accountants=20
make long-range plans, harmony and order are about to be restored. When =
senior=20
scientists address the problems at hand, the problems will soon be =
solved.=20
<P>Truly, this is the Tao of Programming.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>6.2</H3>
<P>Why are programmers non-productive? <BR>Because their time is wasted =
in=20
meetings.=20
<P>Why are programmers rebellious? <BR>Because the management interferes =
too=20
much.=20
<P>Why are the programmers resigning one by one? <BR>Because they are =
burnt out.=20

<P>Having worked for poor management, they no longer value their jobs.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>6.3</H3>
<P>A manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for him =
invented=20
a new program that became popular and sold well. As a result, the =
manager=20
retained his job.=20
<P>The manager tried to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer =
refused=20
it, saying, ``I wrote the program because I thought it was an =
interesting=20
concept, and thus I expect no reward.''=20
<P>The manager upon hearing this remarked, ``This programmer, though he =
holds a=20
position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of an =
employee. Let=20
us promote him to the exalted position of management consultant!''=20
<P>But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, ``I =
exist so=20
that I can program. If I were promoted, I would do nothing but waste =
everyone's=20
time. Can I go now? I have a program that I'm working on."=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>6.4</H3>
<P>A manager went to his programmers and told them: ``As regards to your =
work=20
hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the morning and leave =
at five=20
in the afternoon.'' At this, all of them became angry and several =
resigned on=20
the spot.=20
<P>So the manager said: ``All right, in that case you may set your own =
working=20
hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule.'' The =
programmers, now=20
satisfied, began to come in at noon and work to the wee hours of the =
morning.=20
<HR>

<H2 align=3Dright><A name=3Dbook7>Book 7 - Corporate Wisdom</A></H2>
<P>Thus spake the master programmer:=20
<P>``You can demonstrate a program for a corporate executive, but you =
can't make=20
him computer literate.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>7.1</H3>
<P>A novice asked the master: ``In the east there is a great =
tree-structure that=20
men call `Corporate Headquarters'. It is bloated out of shape with vice=20
presidents and accountants. It issues a multitude of memos, each saying =
`Go,=20
Hence!' or `Go, Hither!' and nobody knows what is meant. Every year new =
names=20
are put onto the branches, but all to no avail. How can such an =
unnatural entity=20
be?"=20
<P>The master replied: ``You perceive this immense structure and are =
disturbed=20
that it has no rational purpose. Can you not take amusement from its =
endless=20
gyrations? Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming beneath =
its=20
sheltering branches? Why are you bothered by its uselessness?''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>7.2</H3>
<P>In the east there is a shark which is larger than all other fish. It =
changes=20
into a bird whose wings are like clouds filling the sky. When this bird =
moves=20
across the land, it brings a message from Corporate Headquarters. This =
message=20
it drops into the midst of the programmers, like a seagull making its =
mark upon=20
the beach. Then the bird mounts on the wind and, with the blue sky at =
its back,=20
returns home.=20
<P>The novice programmer stares in wonder at the bird, for he =
understands it=20
not. The average programmer dreads the coming of the bird, for he fears =
its=20
message. The master programmer continues to work at his terminal, for he =
does=20
not know that the bird has come and gone.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>7.3</H3>
<P>The Magician of the Ivory Tower brought his latest invention for the =
master=20
programmer to examine. The magician wheeled a large black box into the =
master's=20
office while the master waited in silence.=20
<P>``This is an integrated, distributed, general-purpose workstation,'' =
began=20
the magician, ``ergonomically designed with a proprietary operating =
system,=20
sixth generation languages, and multiple state of the art user =
interfaces. It=20
took my assistants several hundred man years to construct. Is it not =
amazing?''=20
<P>The master raised his eyebrows slightly. ``It is indeed amazing,'' he =
said.=20
<P>``Corporate Headquarters has commanded,'' continued the magician, =
``that=20
everyone use this workstation as a platform for new programs. Do you =
agree to=20
this?''=20
<P>``Certainly,'' replied the master, ``I will have it transported to =
the data=20
center immediately!'' And the magician returned to his tower, well =
pleased.=20
<P>Several days later, a novice wandered into the office of the master=20
programmer and said, ``I cannot find the listing for my new program. Do =
you know=20
where it might be?''=20
<P>``Yes,'' replied the master, ``the listings are stacked on the =
platform in=20
the data center.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>7.4</H3>
<P>The master programmer moves from program to program without fear. No =
change=20
in management can harm him. He will not be fired, even if the project is =

cancelled. Why is this? He is filled with Tao.=20
<HR>

<H2 align=3Dright><A name=3Dbook8>Book 8 - Hardware and =
Software</A></H2>
<P>Thus spake the master programmer:=20
<P>``Without the wind, the grass does not move. Without software, =
hardware is=20
useless.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>8.1</H3>
<P>A novice asked the master: ``I perceive that one computer company is =
much=20
larger than all others. It towers above its competition like a giant =
among=20
dwarfs. Any one of its divisions could comprise an entire business. Why =
is this=20
so?''=20
<P>The master replied, ``Why do you ask such foolish questions? That =
company is=20
large because it is large. If it only made hardware, nobody would buy =
it. If it=20
only made software, nobody would use it. If it only maintained systems, =
people=20
would treat it like a servant. But because it combines all of these =
things,=20
people think it one of the gods! By not seeking to strive, it conquers =
without=20
effort.''=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>8.2</H3>
<P>A master programmer passed a novice programmer one day. The master =
noted the=20
novice's preoccupation with a hand-held computer game. ``Excuse me,'' he =
said,=20
``may I examine it?''=20
<P>The novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the master. =
``I see=20
that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy, Medium, and =
Hard,''=20
said the master. ``Yet every such device has another level of play, =
where the=20
device seeks not to conquer the human, nor to be conquered by the =
human.''=20
<P>``Pray, great master,'' implored the novice, ``how does one find this =

mysterious setting?''=20
<P>The master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it underfoot. =
And=20
suddenly the novice was enlightened.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>8.3</H3>
<P>There was once a programmer who worked upon microprocessors. ``Look =
at how=20
well off I am here,'' he said to a mainframe programmer who came to =
visit, ``I=20
have my own operating system and file storage device. I do not have to =
share my=20
resources with anyone. The software is self- consistent and easy-to-use. =
Why do=20
you not quit your present job and join me here?''=20
<P>The mainframe programmer then began to describe his system to his =
friend,=20
saying ``The mainframe sits like an ancient sage meditating in the midst =
of the=20
data center. Its disk drives lie end-to-end like a great ocean of =
machinery. The=20
software is as multifaceted as a diamond, and as convoluted as a =
primeval=20
jungle. The programs, each unique, move through the system like a =
swift-flowing=20
river. That is why I am happy where I am.''=20
<P>The microcomputer programmer, upon hearing this, fell silent. But the =
two=20
programmers remained friends until the end of their days.=20
<H3 align=3Dcenter>8.4</H3>
<P>Hardware met Software on the road to Changtse. Software said: ``You =
are Yin=20
and I am Yang. If we travel together we will become famous and earn vast =
sums of=20
money.'' And so the set forth together, thinking to conquer the world.=20
<P>Presently they met Firmware, who was dressed in tattered rags and =
hobbled=20
along propped on a thorny stick. Firmware said to them: ``The Tao lies =
beyond=20
Yin and Yang. It is silent and still as a pool of water. It does not =
seek fame,=20
therefore nobody knows its presence. It does not seek fortune, for it is =

complete within itself. It exists beyond space and time.''=20
<P>Software and Hardware, ashamed, returned to their homes.=20
<HR>

<H2 align=3Dright><A name=3Dbook9>Book 9 - Epilogue</A></H2>
<P>Thus spake the master programmer:=20
<P>``It is time for you to leave.''=20
