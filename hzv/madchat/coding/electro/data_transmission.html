<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Computing takes place mainly in offices,
factories, and homes. Local Area Networks (LANs) connect workstations in a
building or campus or factory. Soon enough LANs will also connect the equipment
in private homes. These islands of communication need to be interconnected:
using telephone lines (provided by the common carriers), cable, and satellite
communications. In time mobile computing will become commonplace and then also
wearable computers will be integrated in the communication network. The
information exchanged is data, voice, video. Our interest is mainly in data
(digital).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Transmission Media:</b> Copper Wire (Coaxial
Cable, Twisted Pair), Glass Fiber, Microwave, Radio, Infrared. These are the
media usually used in <b>communication channels</b>. In considering different
kinds of media we are concerned, among other things, with the amount of data
that can be transmitted through the medium per unit of time, the power required
for the transmission, its attenuation rate, the distorsion, the error rate, the
cost, and the security.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Simplex/Duplex</i></b>: If in a channel
transmission can take place in only one direction, we say that the transmission
is <b>simplex</b>. If the transmission can take place in both directions, but
not at the same time, we say that the transmission is <b>half-duplex</b>, and if
it can take place at the same time in both directions it is <b>full-duplex</b>.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Multiplexing</i></b>: We often want to
share a communication channel between more than two pairs of communicating
entities. This can be done by <b>Time Division Multiplexing</b> (the channel is
used in different time slots by different pairs of entities) or by <b>Frequency
Division Multiplexing</b> (communicating pairs use different carriers that can
propagate simultaneously through the channel). [There is also, among others, <b>Statistical
Multiplexing</b>.] We call <b>multiplexor</b> the device that inserts two or
more signals into the communication channel, and <b>demultiplexor</b> the device
that separates the signals out.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Digital/Analog Signals</i></b>: The
signals we consider are usually electromagnetic waves. They propagate at the
speed of light (300,000Km/sec) in the vacuum or slightly slower (200,000Km/sec)
in materials. Signals are analog i.e. they are represented as a continuous line
usually with a variety of levels. Digital signals are analog signals that can be
approximated as having two levels, i.e. they are square waves. A communication
channel, usually a local area network, where the signal is digital is called a <b>Baseband
System</b>. If the signal instead is analog we talk of a <b>Broadband System</b>.
[A different interpretation: baseband system = communication system with only
one communication channel; broadband system = system with multiple communication
channels.] A <b>codec </b>(coder/decoder) is a device that transforms analog
signals to/from binary signals (for example, phone, where voice is transformed
into digital signal). For instance the conversion from analog to binary signal
can be done using PCM (Pulse Code Modulation). See below the Nyquist Sampling
Theorem.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Fourier Analysis</i></b>: Any signal can
be expressed as the sum of sinusoidal signals. When desirable, we can focus on
the individual sinusoidal signal instead of the original signal. We talk of the <b>period
</b>of the sinusoidal signal (the time it takes to complete 360 degrees of the
signal), of its <b>wavelength</b> (the space covered by the signal during one
period), and of its <b>frequency</b> (the number of periods that fit in a
second). The period is measured in seconds, the wavelength in meters, and the
frequency in Hertz. We have</font>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New">SignalVelocity = wavelength * frequency</font>
  </dir>
</dir>
<font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Baud Rate</b>: The number of changes in the
signal per unit of time (second). For this rate the number of levels in the
signal is immaterial.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Bandwidth: </b>If we consider the signals
that propagate through a physical medium, there will be one with highest
frequency and one with lowest frequency. The difference between these two
frequencies is the bandwidth of the medium. [Signals with frequencies outside of
this range are with negligible power.] For example for phone communication we
use frequencies between 300Hz and 3300Hz, for a bandwidth of 3000Hz. Normally a
telephone channel is allocated 4KHz. Note that when you hear people talk of baud
rate, they usually mean bandwidth.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Digital/Analog Data</i></b>: Analog data
is real (continuous) data, digital data is binary data. The conversion between
binary data and analog signals is done by <b>modem</b>s (modulator/demodulator).
Some modems use 4 wires (2 to transmit/modulate and 2 to receive/demodulate) to
connect two computers, each computer with its own modem. Most modems are <b>dialup
modems</b>. A computer or terminal can use a dialup modem to connect to the
phone network. This modem has only two wires and it has equipment for making and
receiving phone calls. The two wires are used to transmit and to receive (using
different frequencies). <b>Cable modems</b> are used to connect a computer to a
TV cable network. Data is transmitted usually at different speeds from the cable
to the computer and viceversa. Data rates in the Mbps are possible. Essentially
one TV channel (6 MHz) per direction is shared by all the users connected to the
cable.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Modulation:</i></b> Modulation/Demodulation
is the conversion between binary data and analog signals. Usually the binary
data is used to modify some characteristics of a sinusoidal signal, the <b>carrier</b>.
We can represent the binary data by modifying the amplitude of the carrier<b>(Amplitude
Modulation)</b>, or by modifying its frequency (<b>Frequency Modulation</b>), or
its phase (<b>Phase Shift Modulation</b>).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Data Rate</b>: The number of bits
transmitted per unit of time through the physical medium (also called <b>throughput</b>).
Some examples of data rates:</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Propagation Delay</b>: The time it takes a
signal to propagate from the sender to the receiver. It is the distance divided
by the propagation speed (light).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Transmission Delay</b>, the time it takes to
transmit a message. It is the size of the message in bits divided by the data
rate (measured in bps) of the channel over which the transmission takes place.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Queueing Delay</b>. At a node a message is
received and, if the node is an intermediate node (router), it is scheduled for
transmission (<b>Store-and-Forward</b>). The packet may have to wait if there
are packets ahead of him. This is the queueing delay. Note that if there are 3
packets ahead in the queue, the delay will be 3 * transmission delay.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Notice that we can use the M|M|1 response time
formula to estimate the sum of the Transmission plus Queueing delay on a line.
We consider the line as a Single Server queueing system with service time equal
to the Transmission Delay Tt. We assume that the interarrival time to the line
is Ta. Then the Transmission+Queueing delay is:</font>
<pre><font size="2" face="Courier New">          Tt              Tt
    --------------- = ---------
    1 - utilization   1 - Tt/Ta</font></pre>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So if the utilization is 80%, then the response
time is 5 Tt, i.e. the Queueing delay is 4.2 Tt.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Round-Trip Delay</b>: Time delay from
instant we start a transmission of a message and the instant the acknowledgement
for the message is received. It is at least equal to 2*PropagationDelay +
TransmissionDelay + Queueingdelay. If there are n intermediate nodes there will
be an additional n*(TransmissionDelay+QueueingDelay) delay. Of course there is
also a <b>processing delay</b>. We will assume that it is negligible relative to
the other delays.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Delay-Throughput Product</b>: It represents
the number of bits <b>in transit</b> between the sender and the receiver. It is
the product of the propagation delay times the data rate. So in Ethernet if the
sender is 200 meters away from the receiver, the propagation delay is 1
microsecond, thus, since data rate is 10Mbps, there are 10 bits in transit: no
more at sender, not yet at receiver. It tells us how much data must be
transmitted before the receiver starts getting it. If we are communicating coast
to coast on a one gigabit channel, then the Delay-Throughput product is, since
propagation time is about 20ms, 2.5MB. The Delay-Throughput product has an
impact on the size of the buffers used at the transmitter and receiver. The
buffer size should be at least as big as the delay-throughput product otherwise
some data may get lost (if receiver's buffer is smaller) or the communication
medium (the pipe) may become unfilled (if transmitter's buffer is smaller).
Another aspect of this product: suppose that data at the receiver arrives too
fast and we want to indicate to the sender that it should slow down; then we
need a buffer at the receiving end that is at least 2*Delay-Throughput Product (what
was in the pipe when the receiver decides, plus what transmitted while signal
propagates from receiver to sender).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Bit-Length</b>: The length of a one-bit
signal. It can be easily understood with an example. We are in communication
channel where the data-rate is 10Mbps. That means that one bit is transmitted in
1/10<sup>7</sup> seconds (this is the <b>time-to-transmit-one-bit</b>). Since
signals propagate in a medium at about 200,000km/s, ie 2*10<sup>8</sup> m/s, the
bit-length will be 10<sup>-7</sup> * 2 * 10<sup>8</sup> meters, that is, 20
meters. In general,</font>
<pre><font size="2" face="Courier New">    Bit-Length = SpeedOfLight/DataRate</font></pre>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The larger the bit-length of a channel, the slower
it is that channel.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Nyquist Sampling Theorem:</b> The maximum
data rate D (in bps) of a communication channel (<b>Channel Capacity</b>)with
bandwidth B where we can recognize K levels in the signal is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D = 2 B log<sub>2</sub>(K)<br>
and if the K levels are encoded using m bits we obtain the channel capacity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D = 2 B log<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>m</sup>)
= 2 m B</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another statement of the Sampling Theorem says
that we can reconstruct a signal if we can take two samples of its maximum
frequency. The sampling theorem is the foundation for PCM since it tells how to
sample the analog signal. For example, to binary encode a voice signal, for
example a telephone voice channel (4KHz), by Nyquist we need 8000 samples. We
choose [see below about Signal-to-Noise ratios] to recognize 256 amplitude
levels (8 bits). Thus a voice channel requires 8000 bytes per second, one byte
every 125 microseconds.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In theory, in the absence of noise, according
to <b>Nyquist's Theorem</b> it is possible to obtain codes that have as high a
data rate as desired. Shannon has also derived a theorem (<b>Channel Coding
Theorem</b>) to determine the optimal capacity of a noisy channel as a function
of the bandwidth of the channel and of the <b>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</b>. i.e.
the ratio between the power of the signal and the power of the noise (power of a
signal is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the signal):</font>
<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">    Capacity (in bps) = 1/2 * SamplingRate * log<sub>2</sub>(1 + Signal-to-Noise-Ratio)</font></pre>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">that is, from Nyquist's Sampling Theorem,</font>
<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">    Capacity (in bps)  = Bandwidth * log<sub>2</sub>(1 + Signal-to-Noise-Ratio)</font></pre>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Signal-to-Noise ratios are normally measured in <b>decibels</b>.<br>
Given the ratio S/N, its measure in decibels is <b>10*log<sub>10</sub>(S/N)</b>,
where the log is in base 10. Since the log<sub>10</sub>(2) is about 0.3, 3db
measures in decibels the Signal-to-Noise ratio of 2, which is the smallest
signal to noise ratio that our ears can detect. Phone companies guaranty a
Signal-to-Noise ratio of 48 dbs on phone lines. That means that 10 * log<sub>10</sub>(Signal-to-Noise-ratio)
is 48. Since 48 = 16 * 3 = 16 * 10 * log<sub>10</sub>(2) = 10 * log<sub>10</sub>(2<sup>16</sup>)
we have that S/N &gt;= 2<sup>16</sup>, and if instead of comparing power we
compare amplitudes, the ratio between the amplitude of the signal and the
amplitude of the noise is 2<sup>8</sup> (remember that the power ratio grows
like the square of the amplitude ratio). Going back to the Nyquist Theorem, we
get that we can recognise safely 256 different levels, just as we expected.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In general, if we want to recognize 2<sup>m</sup>
different levels in the Nyquist's Theorem, we need a channel with a
Signal-to-Noise ratio d in decibels of</font>
<pre><font size="2" face="Courier New">    d = 10 * log<sub>10</sub>((2<sup>m</sup>)<sup>2</sup>) = 
	10 * log<sub>10</sub>(2<sup>2m</sup>) = 
	2m * 10 * log<sub>10</sub>(2) = 6m</font></pre>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Viceversa, if we are given a channel with
Bandwidth B and a Signal-to-Noise ratio of d decibels, the data rate D of that
channel will be</font>
<pre><font size="2" face="Courier New">    D = (d/3) * B </font></pre>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">For example if we want to transmit stereo sound
with a bandwidth of 20Khz and a Signal-to-Noise ratio of 96 decibels, we will
need 2 monoaural channels each with bandwidth 20Khz and Signal-to-Noise ratio of
96 decibels. 96 decibels require, as we saw above, 96/6 = 16 bits to represent
the required levels. Thus the monoaural data rate is ~ (96/3) * 20000 = 640 Kbps
and the stereo is 1.28 Mbps. If we were to record this sound on a CD for 70
minutes (the usual CD), we would require a capacity of 2 * 70 * 60 * 640Kb = 2 *
70 * 60 * 80KB = 672MB<br>
Decibels are used in all sorts of situations. You may have heard that a 130
decibel sound will hurt your ears [130 decibels means that the ratio between
this sound and the smallest sound that ear can hear is 130db, i.e. 3*43db = 43 *
10 * log<sub>10</sub>(2) = 10 * log<sub>10</sub>(2<sup>43</sup>), i.e. a sound
that is 2<sup>43</sup> stronger than the smallest sound we can hear.)<br>
And decibels are used to measure the attenuation of signals as they propagate.
For example some light frequencies in an optic fiber attenuates at 0.2 db per
kilometer. That means 3dbs will be lost in 15km, that is that the power of the
signal will be halved in 15km. Attenuation in twisted pair and coaxial cable can
be much greater. For example 3db per km at 10Khz, and much higher at higher at
higher frequencies.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Elementary Coding Theory</b>: Suppose that
we need to transmit a set A of symbols. We will encode the symbols of A with
binary patterns using a code K. Say that a symbol a of A is coded as K(a) with
len(K, a) bits. If p(a) is the probability of transmitting the symbol a, then
the average number of bits used by K to encode a symbol of A is</font>
<pre>	<font size="2" face="Courier New">the sum of p(a)*len(K,a) for all a in A</font></pre>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">For example, if we are using an alphabet with 4
symbols, we can encode these symbols using two bits. But if we know that the
first symbol is used 90% of the time, the second 8%, and the other two each 1%,
then if we encode them as 0, 10, 110, and 111 then the average length of a
symbol becomes 0.9*1+0.08*2+0.01*3+0.01*3 = 1.12 bits, clearly better than 2
bits.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We may wonder what is the best that a code can
do to minimize the average length of the code of a symbol of A. The answer is
given by the <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~hillman/entropy.html">Entropy</a>
of the probability of the symbols of A:</font>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">RS-232 C</FONT></I></B>: Standard for serial
data communication (data, electrical, and mechanical levels). Used to transmit
character data, for example to connect keyboard to computer or modem to
computer. -15 volts is used to represent 1 and +15 volts to represent 0.
When the line is idle the voltage is kept at -15 volts. Each character
is transmitted asynchronously (i.e. the time interval between successive
characters can be of any length) but within a character bits are transmitted
synchronously (i.e. at fixed time intervals). The transmission starts with
a <B>start bit</B> (a 0) and ends with a <B>stop bit</B> (a 1). In between
are sent 7 bits that encode the character. For example the following drawing
represents the character 1100101

The encoding of digital data into binary signals used for RS-232C is called
<B>Non-Return-To-Zero-Level (NRZ-L). </B>It is an encoding such that the
average voltage on the line is non-zero, thus the line must be grounded.
It has another defect: it is not self-synchronizing, in that if we send
a sequence of 0s (or a sequence of 1s) it is difficult for the receiver
to know exactly where each bit is located. An encoding that does not suffer
of these problems is the <B>Differential Manchester</B> encoding which
is used in Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) and in token rings (IEEE 802.5). In Differential
Manchester there will be a level change in the middle of each bit. Then
there will be a transition of level at the beginning of a bit if the bit
is 0, no transition if the bit is 1. Notice that this means that Differential
Manchester is not efficient since it requires up to twice as many level
transitions as there are bits being transmitted.

--><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Asyncronous and Synchronous Transmission</b>:
RS-232 is an example of <b>asyncronous transmission</b>, that is of transmission
where data is not transmitted continuously, instead it is sent as individual
characters, where each character has information to identify its start and its
end. It is a simple and cheap way of transmitting information but it has a high
overhead (in RS-232 two out of nine bits are overhead, i.e. 22%). In <b>synchronous
transmission</b>, whether bit-oriented or character-oriented, each bit occurs at
a predictable position. A transmitted block is started and terminated by a well
defined delimiter (bit stuffing or byte stuffing - see next section) and in
between them the data is transmitted in sequence. Synchronous transmission is
more complex but with lower overhead (thus more efficient in terms of
utilization of the communication channel) than asynchronous transmission.
Example of synchronous codes are BISYNC (for byte oriented bodies) and HDLC (for
bit oriented bodies).</font>
