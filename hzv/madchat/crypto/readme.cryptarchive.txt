PRESENTATION
i believe this to be one of the largest crypto resource on the net,
we hope that as user or developper, you'll enjoy it.

cryptography and steganography are not the serious thing they are
often thought to be : their use is actually fun, and if not, a necessary
evil to protect yourself against the advent of mass data mining.

we would like to thank our nice host too :)


EXPORT
it is my understanding that Lionel Jospin legalised cryptography >128bit
as long as you can provide the attorney general (procureur) with the key

in France, a compagny producing cryptographic software should declare it
to the DCSSI between 40 and 128bits, request permission if above 128.
for signature and authentification only, none is required.


IMPORTATION
check the laws of your country before importation and usage.
there are no export controls for cryptography in the Netherlands, CEE.

http://www.scssi.gouv.fr/fr/reglementation/tab_synth.html
"..Libre dans tous les cas si provenance d'un Etat appartenant a la Communaute
europenne ou etant partie a l'accord instituant l'Espace economique europeen."

all of the softwares presented here are on, were on, or transited by, servers
in the Netherlands, which should therefore also grant their diffusion here.

besides, since Jan 2003, the French government's project is to legalize completely
cryptographic softwares, see http://www.mAdchAt.org/crypto/AFP-crypto-liberee.html
