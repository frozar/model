<a name="22_1"><H3>22.1 Introduction</H3></a>
<P>
We've seen that TCP has the receiver perform flow
control by specifying the amount of data it is willing to accept
from the sender: the window size. What happens when the window
size goes to 0? This effectively stops the sender from transmitting
data, until the window becomes nonzero.
<P>
We saw this scenario in <a href="tcp_bulk.htm#fig_20_3" tppabs="http://www.uic.rnd.runnet.ru/doc/inet/tcp_stevens/tcp_bulk.htm#fig_20_3">Figure 20.3</a>. When
the sender received segment 9, opening the window that was shut
down by segment 8, it immediately started sending data. TCP must
handle the case of this acknowledgment that opens the window (segment
9) being lost. Acknowledgments are not reliably transmitted-that
is, TCP does not ACK acknowledgments, it only ACKs segments containing
data.
<P>
If an acknowledgment is lost, we could end up with
both sides waiting for the other: the receiver waiting to receive
data (since it provided the sender with a nonzero window) and
the sender waiting to receive the window update allowing it to
send. To prevent this form of deadlock from occurring the sender
uses a <I>persist timer</I> that causes it to query the receiver
periodically, to find out if the window has been increased. These
segments from the sender are called <I>window probes.</I> In this
chapter we'll examine window probes and the persist timer. We'll
also examine the silly window syndrome, which is tied to the persist
timer.
<a name="22_2"><H3>22.2 An Example</H3></a>
<P>
To see the persist timer in action we'll start a
receiver process that listens for a connection request from a
client, accepts the connection request, and then goes to sleep
for a long time before reading from the network.
<P>
Our <TT>sock</TT> program lets
us specify a pause option <TT>-P</TT> that
sleeps between the server accepting the connection request and
performing the first read. We'll invoke the server as:
<P>
<TT>svr4 % <B>sock -i -s -P100000
5555</B></TT>
<P>
This has the server sleep for 100,000 seconds (27.8
hours) before reading from the network. The client is run on the
host <TT>bsdi</TT> and performs 1024-byte
writes to port 5555 on the server. Figure 22.1 shows the <TT>tcpdump</TT>
output. (We have removed the connection establishment
from the output.)

<CENTER><B>Figure 22.1</B> Example
of persist timer probing a zero-sized window.</CENTER>
<P>
Segments 1-13 shows the normal data transfer from
the client to the server, filling up the window with 9216 bytes
of data. The server advertises a window of 4096, and has a default
socket buffer size of 4096, but really accepts a total of 9216
bytes. This is some form of interaction between the TCP/IP code
and the streams subsystem in SVR4.
<P>
In segment 13 the server acknowledges the previous
four data segments, but advertises a window of 0, stopping the
client from transmitting any more data. This causes the client
to set its persist timer. If the client doesn't receive a window
update when the timer expires, it probes the empty window, to
see if a window update has been lost. Since our server process
is asleep, the 9216 bytes of data are buffered by TCP, waiting
for the application to issue a read.
<P>
Notice the spacing of the window probes by the client.
The first (segment 14) is 4.949 seconds after receiving the zero-sized
window. The next (segment 16) is 4.996 seconds later. The spacing
is then about 6, 12, 24,48, and 60 seconds after the previous.
<P>
Why are the spacings always a fraction of a second
less than 5,6,12, 24, 48, and 60? These probes are triggered by
TCP's 500-rns timer expiring. When the timer expires, the window
probe is sent, and a reply is received about 4 ms later. The receipt
of the reply causes the timer to be restarted, but the time until
the next clock tick is about 500 minus 4 ms.
<P>
The normal TCP exponential backoff is used when calculating
the persist timer. The first timeout is calculated as 1.5 seconds
for a typical LAN connection. This is multiplied by 2 for a second
timeout value of 3 seconds. A multiplier of 4 gives the next value
of 6, a multiplier of 8 gives a value of 12, and so on. But the
persist timer is always bounded between 5 and 60 seconds, which
accounts for the values we see in <a href="#fig_22_1">Figure 22.1</a>.
<P>
The window probes contain 1 byte of data (sequence
number 9217). TCP is always allowed to send 1 byte of data beyond
the end of a closed window. Notice, however, that the acknowledgments
returned with the window size of 0 do not ACK this byte. (They
ACK the receipt of all bytes through and including byte number
9216.) Therefore this byte keeps being retransmitted.
<P>
The characteristic of the persist state that is different
from the retransmission timeout in <a href="tcp_time.htm#21_0" tppabs="http://www.uic.rnd.runnet.ru/doc/inet/tcp_stevens/tcp_time.htm#21_0">Chapter 21</a> is that TCP <I>never</I>
gives up sending window probes. These window probes continue to
be sent at 60-second intervals until the window opens up or either
of the applications using the connection is terminated.
<a name="22_3"><H3>22.3 Silly Window Syndrome</H3></a>
<P>
Window-based flow control schemes, such as the one
used by TCP, can fall victim to a condition known as the <I>silly
window syndrome</I> (SWS). When it occurs, small amounts of data
are exchanged across the connection, instead of full-sized segments
[dark 1982].
<P>
It can be caused by either end: the receiver can
advertise small windows (instead of waiting until a larger window
could be advertised) and the sender can transmit small amounts
of data (instead of waiting for additional data, to send a larger
segment). Correct avoidance of the silly window syndrome is performed
on both ends.
<OL>
<LI>The receiver must not advertise small windows.
The normal algorithm is for the receiver not to advertise a larger
window than it is currently advertising (which can be 0) until
the window can be increased by either one full-sized segment (i.e„
the MSS being received) or by one-half the receiver's buffer space,
whichever is smaller.
<LI>Sender avoidance of the silly window syndrome
is done by not transmitting unless one of the following conditions
is true: (a) a full-sized segment can be sent, (b) we can send
at least one-half of the maximum sized window that the other end
has ever advertised, or (c) we can send everything we have and
either we are not expecting an ACK (i.e., we have no outstanding
unacknowledged data) or the Nagle algorithm is disabled for this
connection (<a href="tcp_int.htm#19_4" tppabs="http://www.uic.rnd.runnet.ru/doc/inet/tcp_stevens/tcp_int.htm#19_4">Section 19.4</a>).
<P>
Condition (b) deals with hosts that always advertise
tiny windows, perhaps smaller than the segment size. Condition
(c) prevents us from sending small segments when we have unacknowledged
data that is waiting to be ACKed and the Nagle algorithm is enabled.
If the application is doing small writes (e.g., smaller than the
segment size), it is condition (c) that avoids the silly window
syndrome.
<P>
These three conditions also let us answer the
question: if the Nagle algorithm prevents us from sending small
segments while there is outstanding unacknowledged data, how small
is small? From condition (a) we see that &quot;small&quot; means
the number of bytes is less than the segment size. Condition (b)
only comes into play with older, primitive hosts.
</OL>
<P>
Condition (b) in step 2 requires that the sender
keep track of the maximum window size advertised by the other
end. This is an attempt by the sender to guess the size of the
other end's receive buffer. Although the size of the receiver
buffer could decrease while the connection is established, in
practice this is rare.
<H4>An Example</H4>
<P>
We'll now go through a detailed example to see the
silly window syndrome avoidance in action, which also involves
the persist timer. We'll use our <TT>sock</TT>
program with the sending host, <TT>sun</TT>,
doing six 1024-byte writes to the network:
<P>
<TT>sun % <B>sock -i -n6 bsdi
7777</B></TT>
<P>
But we'll put some pauses in the receiving process
on the host <TT>bsdi</TT>, pausing 4 seconds
before doing the first read, and then pausing 2 seconds between
successive reads. Additionally, the receiver issues 256-byte reads;
<P>
<TT>bsdi % <B>sock -i -s -P4 -p2
-r256 7777</B></TT>
<P>
The reason for the initial pause is to let the receiver's
buffer fill, forcing it to stop the transmitter. Since the receiver
then performs small reads from the network, we expect to see the
receiver perform silly window syndrome avoidance.
<P>
Figure 22.2 is the time line for the transfer of
the 6144 bytes of data. (We have deleted the connection establishment.)
<P>
We also need to track what happens with the application
that's reading the data at each point in time, along with the
number of bytes currently in the receive buffer, and the number
of bytes of available space in the receive buffer. Figure 22.3
shows everything that's happening.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Figure 22.3</B> Sequence
of events for receiver avoidance of the silly window syndrome.</CENTER>
<P>
In Figure 22.3 the first column is the relative point
in time for each action. Those times with three digits to the
right of the decimal point are taken from the <TT>tcpdump</TT>
output (<a href="#fig_22_2">Figure 22.2</a>). Those times with 99 to the right of the
decimal point are the assumed times of the action on the receiving
host. (Having these relative times on the receiver contain 99
for the hundredths of a second correlates them with segments 20
and 22 in <a href="#fig_22_2">Figure 22.2</a>, the only two events on the receiver that
we can see with <TT>tcpdump</TT> that are
triggered by a timeout on the receiving host. All the other packets
that we see from <TT>bsdi</TT> are triggered
by the reception of a segment from the sender. It also makes sense,
because this would place the initial 4-second pause just before
time 0 when the sender transmits the first data segment. This
is about when the receiver would get control, after receiving
the ACK of its SYN in the connection establishment.)
<P>
The amount of data in the receiver's buffer increases
when it receives data from the sender, and decreases as the application
reads data from the buffer. What we want to follow are the window
advertisements sent by the receiver to the sender, and what those
window advertisements are. This lets us see how the silly window
syndrome is avoided by the receiver.
<P>
The first four data segments and the corresponding
ACK (segments 1-5) show the sender filling the receiver's buffer.
At that point the sender is stopped but it still has more data
to send. It sets its persist timer for its minimum value of 5
seconds.
<P>
When the persist timer expires, 1 byte of data is
sent (segment 6). The receiving application has read 256 bytes
from the receive buffer (at time 3.99), so the byte is accepted
and acknowledged (segment 7). But the advertised window is still
0, since the receiver does not have room for either one full-sized
segment or one-half of its buffer. This is silly window avoidance
by the receiver.
<P>
The sender's persist timer is reset and goes off
again 5 seconds later (at time 10.151). One byte is again sent
and acknowledged (segments 8 and 9). Again the amount of room
in the receiver's buffer (1022 bytes) forces it to advertise a
window of 0.
<P>
When the sender's persist timer expires next, at
time 15.151, another byte is sent and acknowledged (segments 10
and 11). This time the receiver has 1533 bytes available in its
buffer, so a nonzero window is advertised. The sender immediately
takes advantage of the window and sends 1024 bytes (segment 12).
The acknowledgment of these 1024 bytes (segment 13) advertises
a window of 509 bytes. This appears to contradict what we've seen
earlier with small window advertisements.
<P>
What's happening here is that segment 11 advertised
a window of 1533 bytes but the sender only transmitted 1024 bytes.
If the acknowledgment in segment 13 advertised a window of 0,
it would violate the TCP principle that a window cannot shrink
by moving the right edge of the window to the left (<a href="tcp_bulk.htm#20_3" tppabs="http://www.uic.rnd.runnet.ru/doc/inet/tcp_stevens/tcp_bulk.htm#20_3">Section 20.3</a>).
That's why the small window of 509 bytes must be advertised.
<P>
Next we see that the sender does not immediately
transmit into this small window. This is silly window avoidance
by the sender. Instead it waits for another persist timer to expire
at time 20.151, when it sends 509 bytes. Even though it ends up
sending this small segment with 509 bytes of data, it waits 5
seconds before doing so, to see if an ACK arrives that opens up
the window more. These 509 bytes of data leave only 768 bytes
of available space in the receive buffer, so the acknowledgment
(segment 15) advertises a window of 0.
<P>
The persist timer goes off again at time 25.151,
and the sender transmits 1 byte. The receive buffer then has 1279
bytes of space, which is the window advertised in segment 17.
<P>
The sender has only 511 additional bytes of data
to transmit, which it sends immediately upon receiving the window
advertisement of 1279 (segment 18). This segment also contains
the FIN flag. The receiver acknowledges the data and the FIN,
advertising a window of 767. (See Exercise 22.2.)
<P>
Since the sending application issues a close after
performing its six 1024-byte writes, the sender's end of the connection
goes from the ESTABLISHED state to the FIN_WAIT_1 state, to the
FIN_WAIT_2 state (<a href="tcp_conn.htm#fig_18_12" tppabs="http://www.uic.rnd.runnet.ru/doc/inet/tcp_stevens/tcp_conn.htm#fig_18_12">Figure 18.12</a>). It sits in this state until receiving
a FIN from the other end. There is no timer in this state (recall
our discussion at the end of <a href="tcp_conn.htm#18_6" tppabs="http://www.uic.rnd.runnet.ru/doc/inet/tcp_stevens/tcp_conn.htm#18_6">Section 18.6</a>), since the FIN that
it sent in segment 18 was acknowledged in segment 19. This is
why we see no further transmissions by the sender until it receives
the FIN (segment 21).
<P>
The receiving application continues reading 256 bytes
of data every 2 seconds from the receive buffer. Why is the ACK
sent at time 39.99 (segment 20)? The amount of room in the receive
buffer has gone from its last advertised value of 767 (segment
19) to 2816 when the application reads at time 39.99. This equals
2049 bytes of additional space in the receive buffer. Recalling
the first rule at the start of this section, the receiver now
sends a window update because the amount of room has increased
by one-half the room in the receive buffer. This implies that
the receiving TCP checks whether to send a window update every
time the application reads data from TCP's receive buffer.
<P>
The final application read occurs at time 51.99 and
the application receives an end-of-file notification, since the
buffer is empty. This causes the final two segments (21 and 22),
which complete the termination of the connection.
<a name="22_4"><H3>22.4 Summary</H3></a>
<P>
TCP's persist timer is set by one end of a connection
when it has data to send, but has been stopped because the other
end has advertised a zero-sized window. The sender keeps probing
the closed window using a retransmission interval similar to what
we saw in <a href="tcp_time.htm#21_0" tppabs="http://www.uic.rnd.runnet.ru/doc/inet/tcp_stevens/tcp_time.htm#21_0">Chapter 21</a>. This probing of the closed window continues
indefinitely.
<P>
When we ran an example to see the persist timer we
also encountered TCP's avoidance of the silly window syndrome.
This is to prevent TCP from advertising small windows or from
sending small segments. In our example we saw avoidance of the
silly window syndrome by both the sender and the receiver.
<H4>Exercises</H4>
<P>
<B>22.1</B> In <a href="#fig_22_3">Figure 22.3</a> notice
the times of all the acknowledgments (segments 5, 7, 9, 11, 13,
15, and 17): 0.170, 5.170, 10.170, 15.170, 15.370, 20.170, and
25.170. Also notice the time differences between receiving the
data and sending the ACK: 164.5, 18.5, 18.7, 18.8, 198.3, 18.5,
and 19.1 ms. Explain what's probably going on.
<P>
<B>22.2</B> In <a href="#fig_22_3">Figure 22.3</a> at
time 25.174 a window of 767 is advertised, but 768 bytes are available
in the receive buffer. Why the difference of 1 byte?
